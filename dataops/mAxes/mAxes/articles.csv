previous dorylomorph subfamilies were synonymized under dorylinae by brady et al. in 2014[4] ants are eusocial insects of the family formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order hymenoptera. ants appear in the fossil record across the globe in considerable diversity during the latest early cretaceous and early late cretaceous, suggesting an earlier origin. ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the cretaceous period, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. more than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. they are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called ""drones"" (aner) and one or more fertile females called ""queens"" (gynes). the colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony. ants have colonised almost every landmass on earth. the only places lacking indigenous ants are antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the terrestrial animal biomass. their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships. ant societies have division of labour, communication between individuals, and an ability to solve complex problems. these parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study. many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. some species, such as the red imported fire ant (solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally. the word ant and its chiefly dialectal form emmet[5] come from ante, emete of middle english, which come from ǣmette of old english, and these are all related to the dialectal dutch emt and the old high german āmeiza, from which comes the modern german ameise. all of these words come from west germanic *ǣmaitjōn, and the original meaning of the word was ""the biter"" (from proto-germanic *ai-, ""off, away"" + *mait- ""cut"").[6][7] the family name formicidae is derived from the latin formīca (""ant"")[8] from which the words in other romance languages, such as the portuguese formiga, italian formica, spanish hormiga, romanian furnică, and french fourmi are derived. it has been hypothesised that a proto-indo-european word *morwi- was used, cf. sanskrit vamrah, greek μύρμηξ mýrmēx, old church slavonic mraviji, old irish moirb, old norse maurr, dutch mier, swedish myra, danish myre, middle dutch miere, crimean gothic miera.[9][10] chrysidoidea vespidae rhopalosomatidae pompilidae tiphiidae scolioidea apoidea formicidae the family formicidae belongs to the order hymenoptera, which also includes sawflies, bees, and wasps. ants evolved from a lineage within the stinging wasps, and a 2013 study suggests that they are a sister group of the apoidea.[11] in 1966, e. o. wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant (sphecomyrma) that lived in the cretaceous period. the specimen, trapped in amber dating back to around 92 million years ago, has features found in some wasps, but not found in modern ants.[12] sphecomyrma was possibly a ground forager, while haidomyrmex and haidomyrmodes, related genera in subfamily sphecomyrminae, are reconstructed as active arboreal predators.[13] older ants in the genus sphecomyrmodes have been found in 99 million year-old amber from myanmar.[14][15] a 2006 study suggested that ants arose tens of millions of years earlier than previously thought, up to 168 million years ago.[1] after the rise of flowering plants about 100 million years ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around 60 million years ago.[16][1][17][18] some groups, such as the leptanillinae and martialinae, are suggested to have diversified from early primitive ants that were likely to have been predators underneath the surface of the soil.[3][19] during the cretaceous period, a few species of primitive ants ranged widely on the laurasian supercontinent (the northern hemisphere). they were scarce in comparison to the populations of other insects, representing only about 1% of the entire insect population. ants became dominant after adaptive radiation at the beginning of the paleogene period. by the oligocene and miocene, ants had come to represent 20–40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. of the species that lived in the eocene epoch, around one in 10 genera survive to the present. genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in baltic amber fossils (early oligocene), and 92% of the genera in dominican amber fossils (apparently early miocene).[16][20] termites live in colonies and are sometimes called ‘white ants’, but termites are not ants. they are the sub-order isoptera, and together with cockroaches they form the order blattodea. blattodeans are related to mantids, crickets, and other winged insects that do not undergo full metamorphosis. like ants, termites are eusocial, with sterile workers, but they differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction. the similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution.[21] velvet ants look like large ants, but are wingless female wasps.[22][23] ants are found on all continents except antarctica, and only a few large islands, such as greenland, iceland, parts of polynesia and the hawaiian islands lack native ant species.[25][26] ants occupy a wide range of ecological niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20 % (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.[27] ants range in size from 0.75 to 52 millimetres (0.030–2.0 in),[28][29] the largest species being the fossil titanomyrma giganteum, the queen of which was 6 centimetres (2.4 in) long with a wingspan of 15 centimetres (5.9 in).[30] ants vary in colour; most ants are red or black, but a few species are green and some tropical species have a metallic lustre. more than 12,000 species are currently known (with upper estimates of the potential existence of about 22,000; see the article list of ant genera), with the greatest diversity in the tropics. taxonomic studies continue to resolve the classification and systematics of ants. online databases of ant species, including antbase and the hymenoptera name server, help to keep track of the known and newly described species.[31] the relative ease with which ants may be sampled and studied in ecosystems has made them useful as indicator species in biodiversity studies.[32][33] ants are distinct in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, and a strong constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. the head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments (formally tagmata). the petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). the petiole may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or the second and third abdominal segments).[34] like other insects, ants have an exoskeleton, an external covering that provides a protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscles, in contrast to the internal skeletons of humans and other vertebrates. insects do not have lungs; oxygen and other gases, such as carbon dioxide, pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called spiracles. insects also lack closed blood vessels; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube along the top of the body (called the ""dorsal aorta"") that functions like a heart, and pumps haemolymph toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. the nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord that runs the length of the body, with several ganglia and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.[35] an ant's head contains many sensory organs. like most insects, ants have compound eyes made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. ant eyes are good for acute movement detection, but do not offer a high resolution image. they also have three small ocelli (simple eyes) on the top of the head that detect light levels and polarization.[36] compared to vertebrates, ants tend to have blurrier eyesight, particularly in smaller species,[37] and a few subterranean taxa are completely blind.[2] however, some ants, such as australia's bulldog ant, have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away.[38] two antennae (""feelers"") are attached to the head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents, and vibrations; they also are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. the head has two strong jaws, the mandibles, used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence.[35] in some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, so it may be passed to other ants or their larvae.[39] both the legs and wings of the ant are attached to the mesosoma (""thorax""). the legs terminate in a hooked claw which allows them to hook on and climb surfaces.[40] only reproductive ants, queens, and males, have wings. queens shed their wings after the nuptial flight, leaving visible stubs, a distinguishing feature of queens. in a few species, wingless queens (ergatoids) and males occur.[35] the metasoma (the ""abdomen"") of the ant houses important internal organs, including those of the reproductive, respiratory (tracheae), and excretory systems. workers of many species have their egg-laying structures modified into stings that are used for subduing prey and defending their nests.[35] in the colonies of a few ant species, there are physical castes—workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major ergates. often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. these are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates.[41] although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called ""soldier"" ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their ""duties"" typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. in a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors.[42] weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution.[43][44] some other species show continuous variation in the size of workers. the smallest and largest workers in pheidologeton diversus show nearly a 500-fold difference in their dry-weights.[45] workers cannot mate; however, because of the haplodiploid sex-determination system in ants, workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile, haploid males. the role of workers may change with their age and in some species, such as honeypot ants, young workers are fed until their gasters are distended, and act as living food storage vessels. these food storage workers are called repletes.[46] for instance, these replete workers develop in the north american honeypot ant myrmecocystus mexicanus. usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes; and, if repletes are removed from the colony, other workers become repletes, demonstrating the flexibility of this particular polymorphism.[47] this polymorphism in morphology and behaviour of workers initially was thought to be determined by environmental factors such as nutrition and hormones that led to different developmental paths; however, genetic differences between worker castes have been noted in acromyrmex sp.[48] these polymorphisms are caused by relatively small genetic changes; differences in a single gene of solenopsis invicta can decide whether the colony will have single or multiple queens.[49] the australian jack jumper ant (myrmecia pilosula) has only a single pair of chromosomes (with the males having just one chromosome as they are haploid), the lowest number known for any animal, making it an interesting subject for studies in the genetics and developmental biology of social insects.[50][51] the life of an ant starts from an egg; if the egg is fertilised, the progeny will be female diploid, if not, it will be male haploid. ants develop by complete metamorphosis with the larva stages passing through a pupal stage before emerging as an adult. the larva is largely immobile and is fed and cared for by workers. food is given to the larvae by trophallaxis, a process in which an ant regurgitates liquid food held in its crop. this is also how adults share food, stored in the ""social stomach"". larvae, especially in the later stages, may also be provided solid food, such as trophic eggs, pieces of prey, and seeds brought by workers.[52] the larvae grow through a series of four or five moults and enter the pupal stage. the pupa has the appendages free and not fused to the body as in a butterfly pupa.[53] the differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different castes of workers, is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research.[54] winged male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the usually winged breeding females. some species, such as army ants, have wingless queens. larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.[55] a new ergate spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. she then graduates to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. these changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. an explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.[56][57] ant colonies can be long-lived. the queens can live for up to 30 years, and workers live from 1 to 3 years. males, however, are more transitory, being quite short-lived and surviving for only a few weeks.[58] ant queens are estimated to live 100 times as long as solitary insects of a similar size.[59] ants are active all year long in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter in a state of dormancy known as hibernation. the forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state (diapause), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.[60] a wide range of reproductive strategies have been noted in ant species. females of many species are known to be capable of reproducing asexually through thelytokous parthenogenesis.[61] secretions from the male accessory glands in some species can plug the female genital opening and prevent females from re-mating.[62] most ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females have the ability to mate. contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens, while others may exist without queens. workers with the ability to reproduce are called ""gamergates"" and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies; colonies with queens are said to be queen-right.[63] drones can also mate with existing queens by entering a foreign colony, such as in army ants. when the drone is initially attacked by the workers, it releases a mating pheromone. if recognized as a mate, it will be carried to the queen to mate.[64] males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. the marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.[65] most ants are univoltine, producing a new generation each year.[66] during the species-specific breeding period, winged females and winged males, known to entomologists as alates, leave the colony in what is called a nuptial flight. the nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid. heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests.[67] males typically take flight before the females. males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.[68] mated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony. there, they break off their wings using their tibial spurs and begin to lay and care for eggs. the females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. the first workers to hatch are known as nanitics,[69] and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. they enlarge the nest, forage for food, and care for the other eggs. species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site,[68] a process akin to swarming in honeybees. ants communicate with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch.[70] the use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. the paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. in species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. when the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. this behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. for instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. if an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.[71] ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. a crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. several ant species even use ""propaganda pheromones"" to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves.[72] pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia.[59] pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony.[73] this allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to.[74] in ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to raise new queens in the colony.[75] some ants produce sounds by stridulation, using the gaster segments and their mandibles. sounds may be used to communicate with colony members or with other species.[76][77] ants attack and defend themselves by biting and, in many species, by stinging, often injecting or spraying chemicals, such as formic acid in the case of formicine ants, alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants, and a variety of protein components in other ants. bullet ants (paraponera), located in central and south america, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans. this sting is given the highest rating on the schmidt sting pain index.[78] the sting of jack jumper ants can be fatal,[79] and an antivenom has been developed for it.[80] fire ants, solenopsis spp., are unique in having a venom sac containing piperidine alkaloids.[81] their stings are painful and can be dangerous to hypersensitive people.[82] trap-jaw ants of the genus odontomachus are equipped with mandibles called trap-jaws, which snap shut faster than any other predatory appendages within the animal kingdom.[83] one study of odontomachus bauri recorded peak speeds of between 126 and 230 km/h (78 and 143 mph), with the jaws closing within 130 microseconds on average. the ants were also observed to use their jaws as a catapult to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat.[83] before striking, the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism. energy is stored in a thick band of muscle and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of sensory organs resembling hairs on the inside of the mandibles. the mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks. trap-jaws also are seen in the following genera: anochetus, orectognathus, and strumigenys,[83] plus some members of the dacetini tribe,[84] which are viewed as examples of convergent evolution. a malaysian species of ant in the camponotus cylindricus group has enlarged mandibular glands that extend into their gaster. if combat takes a turn for the worse, a worker may perform a final act of suicidal altruism by rupturing the membrane of its gaster, causing the content of its mandibular glands to burst from the anterior region of its head, spraying a poisonous, corrosive secretion containing acetophenones and other chemicals that immobilise small insect attackers. the worker subsequently dies.[85] suicidal defences by workers are also noted in a brazilian ant, forelius pusillus, where a small group of ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.[86] in addition to defence against predators, ants need to protect their colonies from pathogens. some worker ants maintain the hygiene of the colony and their activities include undertaking or necrophory, the disposal of dead nest-mates.[87] oleic acid has been identified as the compound released from dead ants that triggers necrophoric behaviour in atta mexicana[88] while workers of linepithema humile react to the absence of characteristic chemicals (dolichodial and iridomyrmecin) present on the cuticle of their living nestmates to trigger similar behaviour.[89] nests may be protected from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture.[90][91] workers of cataulacus muticus, an arboreal species that lives in plant hollows, respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside.[92] camponotus anderseni, which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats, deals with submergence under water by switching to anaerobic respiration.[93] many animals can learn behaviours by imitation, but ants may be the only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. a knowledgeable forager of temnothorax albipennis can lead a naïve nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running. the follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. the leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.[94] controlled experiments with colonies of cerapachys biroi suggest that an individual may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. an entire generation of identical workers was divided into two groups whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. one group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. as a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. a month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.[95] complex nests are built by many ant species, but other species are nomadic and do not build permanent structures. ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. these nests may be found in the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. the materials used for construction include soil and plant matter,[68] and ants carefully select their nest sites; temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. they are quick to abandon established nests at the first sign of threats.[96] the army ants of south america, such as the eciton burchellii species, and the driver ants of africa do not build permanent nests, but instead, alternate between nomadism and stages where the workers form a temporary nest (bivouac) from their own bodies, by holding each other together.[97] weaver ant (oecophylla spp.) workers build nests in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of polyrhachis.[98] formica polyctena, among other ant species, constructs nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that aids in the development of larvae. the ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials.[99] some ant species, such as those that use natural cavities, can be opportunistic and make use of the controlled micro-climate provided inside human dwellings and other artificial structures to house their colonies and nest structures.[100][101] most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores,[17] but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. it is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes [102] to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect [103] and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies.[104] leafcutter ants (atta and acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. they continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. the largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. if a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. the ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi.[105] foraging ants travel distances of up to 200 metres (700 ft) from their nest [106] and scent trails allow them to find their way back even in the dark. in hot and arid regions, day-foraging ants face death by desiccation, so the ability to find the shortest route back to the nest reduces that risk. diurnal desert ants of the genus cataglyphis such as the sahara desert ant navigate by keeping track of direction as well as distance travelled. distances travelled are measured using an internal pedometer that keeps count of the steps taken[107] and also by evaluating the movement of objects in their visual field (optical flow).[108] directions are measured using the position of the sun.[109] they integrate this information to find the shortest route back to their nest.[110] like all ants, they can also make use of visual landmarks when available[111] as well as olfactory and tactile cues to navigate.[112][113] some species of ant are able to use the earth's magnetic field for navigation.[114] the compound eyes of ants have specialised cells that detect polarised light from the sun, which is used to determine direction.[115][116] these polarization detectors are sensitive in the ultraviolet region of the light spectrum.[117] in some army ant species, a group of foragers who become separated from the main column may sometimes turn back on themselves and form a circular ant mill. the workers may then run around continuously until they die of exhaustion.[118] the female worker ants do not have wings and reproductive females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. some species are capable of leaping. for example, jerdon's jumping ant (harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs.[119] there are several species of gliding ant including cephalotes atratus; this may be a common trait among arboreal ants with small colonies. ants with this ability are able to control their horizontal movement so as to catch tree trunks when they fall from atop the forest canopy.[120] other species of ants can form chains to bridge gaps over water, underground, or through spaces in vegetation. some species also form floating rafts that help them survive floods.[121] these rafts may also have a role in allowing ants to colonise islands.[122] polyrhachis sokolova, a species of ant found in australian mangrove swamps, can swim and live in underwater nests. since they lack gills, they go to trapped pockets of air in the submerged nests to breathe.[123] not all ants have the same kind of societies. the australian bulldog ants are among the biggest and most basal of ants. like virtually all ants, they are eusocial, but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species. each individual hunts alone, using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find prey.[124] some species (such as tetramorium caespitum) attack and take over neighbouring ant colonies. others are less expansionist, but just as aggressive; they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either eat or raise as workers or slaves. extreme specialists among these slave-raiding ants, such as the amazon ants, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive.[125] captured workers of enslaved temnothorax species have evolved a counter strategy, destroying just the female pupae of the slave-making temnothorax americanus, but sparing the males (who don't take part in slave-raiding as adults).[126] ants identify kin and nestmates through their scent, which comes from hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. if an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked.[127] also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other even if they are of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. the argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it. parasitic ant species enter the colonies of host ants and establish themselves as social parasites; species such as strumigenys xenos are entirely parasitic and do not have workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their strumigenys perplexa hosts.[128][129] this form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. a variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant. a parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. some simply fight their way into the nest.[130] a conflict between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. the most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. an extreme of sexual conflict is seen in wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.[131] ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. they also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. these inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. the nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. others show wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.[132][133] aphids and other hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called honeydew, when they feed on plant sap. the sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect.[134] in some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew in response to ants tapping them with their antennae. the ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. when migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.[135] myrmecophilous (ant-loving) caterpillars of the butterfly family lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. the caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants.[136] a similar adaptation can be seen in grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies.[137] other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. the caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.[138] a number of specialized bacteria have been found as endosymbionts in ant guts. some of the dominant bacteria belong to the order rhizobiales whose members are known for being nitrogen-fixing symbionts in legumes but the species found in ant lack the ability to fix nitrogen.[139][140] fungus-growing ants that make up the tribe attini, including leafcutter ants, cultivate certain species of fungus in the genera leucoagaricus or leucocoprinus of the family agaricaceae. in this ant-fungus mutualism, both species depend on each other for survival. the ant allomerus decemarticulatus has evolved a three-way association with the host plant, hirtella physophora (chrysobalanaceae), and a sticky fungus which is used to trap their insect prey.[141] lemon ants make devil's gardens by killing surrounding plants with their stings and leaving a pure patch of lemon ant trees, (duroia hirsuta). this modification of the forest provides the ants with more nesting sites inside the stems of the duroia trees.[142] although some ants obtain nectar from flowers, pollination by ants is somewhat rare, one example being of the pollination of the orchid leporella fimbriata which induces male myrmecia urens to pseudocopulate with the flowers, transferring pollen in the process.[143] one theory that has been proposed for the rarity of pollination is that the secretions of the metapleural gland inactivate and reduce the viability of pollen.[144][145] some plants have special nectar exuding structures, extrafloral nectaries, that provide food for ants, which in turn protect the plant from more damaging herbivorous insects.[146] species such as the bullhorn acacia (acacia cornigera) in central america have hollow thorns that house colonies of stinging ants (pseudomyrmex ferruginea) who defend the tree against insects, browsing mammals, and epiphytic vines. isotopic labelling studies suggest that plants also obtain nitrogen from the ants.[147] in return, the ants obtain food from protein- and lipid-rich beltian bodies. in fiji philidris nagasau (dolichoderinae) are known to selectively grow species of epiphytic squamellaria (rubiaceae) which produce large domatia inside which the ant colonies nest. the ants plant the seeds and the domatia of young seedling are immediately occupied and the ant faeces in them contribute to rapid growth.[148] similar dispersal associations are found with other dolichoderines in the region as well.[149] another example of this type of ectosymbiosis comes from the macaranga tree, which has stems adapted to house colonies of crematogaster ants.[150] many plant species have seeds that are adapted for dispersal by ants.[151] seed dispersal by ants or myrmecochory is widespread, and new estimates suggest that nearly 9% of all plant species may have such ant associations.[152][151] often, seed-dispersing ants perform directed dispersal, depositing the seeds in locations that increase the likelihood of seed survival to reproduction.[153] some plants in arid, fire-prone systems are particularly dependent on ants for their survival and dispersal as the seeds are transported to safety below the ground.[154] many ant-dispersed seeds have special external structures, elaiosomes, that are sought after by ants as food.[155] a convergence, possibly a form of mimicry, is seen in the eggs of stick insects. they have an edible elaiosome-like structure and are taken into the ant nest where the young hatch.[156] most ants are predatory and some prey on and obtain food from other social insects including other ants. some species specialise in preying on termites (megaponera and termitopone) while a few cerapachyinae prey on other ants.[106] some termites, including nasutitermes corniger, form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species.[157] the tropical wasp mischocyttarus drewseni coats the pedicel of its nest with an ant-repellent chemical.[158] it is suggested that many tropical wasps may build their nests in trees and cover them to protect themselves from ants. other wasps, such as a. multipicta, defend against ants by blasting them off the nest with bursts of wing buzzing.[159] stingless bees (trigona and melipona) use chemical defences against ants.[106] flies in the old world genus bengalia (calliphoridae) prey on ants and are kleptoparasites, snatching prey or brood from the mandibles of adult ants.[160] wingless and legless females of the malaysian phorid fly (vestigipoda myrmolarvoidea) live in the nests of ants of the genus aenictus and are cared for by the ants.[160] fungi in the genera cordyceps and ophiocordyceps infect ants. ants react to their infection by climbing up plants and sinking their mandibles into plant tissue. the fungus kills the ants, grows on their remains, and produces a fruiting body. it appears that the fungus alters the behaviour of the ant to help disperse its spores [161] in a microhabitat that best suits the fungus.[162] strepsipteran parasites also manipulate their ant host to climb grass stems, to help the parasite find mates.[163] a nematode (myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (cephalotes atratus) causes the black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. the parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, causing them to carry their gasters high. the conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. the droppings of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.[164] south american poison dart frogs in the genus dendrobates feed mainly on ants, and the toxins in their skin may come from the ants.[165] army ants forage in a wide roving column, attacking any animals in that path that are unable to escape. in central and south america, eciton burchellii is the swarming ant most commonly attended by ""ant-following"" birds such as antbirds and woodcreepers.[166][167] this behaviour was once considered mutualistic, but later studies found the birds to be parasitic. direct kleptoparasitism (birds stealing food from the ants' grasp) is rare and has been noted in inca doves which pick seeds at nest entrances as they are being transported by species of pogonomyrmex.[168] birds that follow ants eat many prey insects and thus decrease the foraging success of ants.[169] birds indulge in a peculiar behaviour called anting that, as yet, is not fully understood. here birds rest on ant nests, or pick and drop ants onto their wings and feathers; this may be a means to remove ectoparasites from the birds. anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins, echidnas and numbats have special adaptations for living on a diet of ants. these adaptations include long, sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests. brown bears (ursus arctos) have been found to feed on ants. about 12%, 16%, and 4% of their faecal volume in spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, is composed of ants.[170] ants perform many ecological roles that are beneficial to humans, including the suppression of pest populations and aeration of the soil. the use of weaver ants in citrus cultivation in southern china is considered one of the oldest known applications of biological control.[171] on the other hand, ants may become nuisances when they invade buildings, or cause economic losses. in some parts of the world (mainly africa and south america), large ants, especially army ants, are used as surgical sutures. the wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. the ant seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles and locks in place. the body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound.[172][173][174] the large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.[175] some ants have toxic venom and are of medical importance. the species include paraponera clavata (tocandira) and dinoponera spp. (false tocandiras) of south america [176] and the myrmecia ants of australia.[177] in south africa, ants are used to help harvest the seeds of rooibos (aspalathus linearis), a plant used to make a herbal tea. the plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual collection difficult. black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest, where humans can gather them en masse. up to half a pound (200 g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.[178][179] although most ants survive attempts by humans to eradicate them, a few are highly endangered. these tend to be island species that have evolved specialized traits and risk being displaced by introduced ant species. examples include the critically endangered sri lankan relict ant (aneuretus simoni) and adetomyrma venatrix of madagascar.[180] it has been estimated by e. o. wilson that the total number of individual ants alive in the world at any one time is between one and ten quadrillion (short scale) (i.e., between 1015 and 1016). according to this estimate, the total biomass of all the ants in the world is approximately equal to the total biomass of the entire human race.[181] according to this estimate, there are also approximately 1 million ants for every human on earth.[182] ants and their larvae are eaten in different parts of the world. the eggs of two species of ants are used in mexican escamoles. they are considered a form of insect caviar and can sell for as much as us$40 per pound ($90/kg) because they are seasonal and hard to find. in the colombian department of santander, hormigas culonas (roughly interpreted as ""large-bottomed ants"") atta laevigata are toasted alive and eaten.[183] in areas of india, and throughout burma and thailand, a paste of the green weaver ant (oecophylla smaragdina) is served as a condiment with curry.[184] weaver ant eggs and larvae, as well as the ants, may be used in a thai salad, yam (thai: ยำ), in a dish called yam khai mot daeng (thai: ยำไข่มดแดง) or red ant egg salad, a dish that comes from the issan or north-eastern region of thailand. saville-kent, in the naturalist in australia wrote ""beauty, in the case of the green ant, is more than skin-deep. their attractive, almost sweetmeat-like translucency possibly invited the first essays at their consumption by the human species"". mashed up in water, after the manner of lemon squash, ""these ants form a pleasant acid drink which is held in high favor by the natives of north queensland, and is even appreciated by many european palates"".[185] in his first summer in the sierra, john muir notes that the digger indians of california ate the tickling, acid gasters of the large jet-black carpenter ants. the mexican indians eat the replete workers, or living honey-pots, of the honey ant (myrmecocystus).[185] some ant species are considered as pests, primarily those that occur in human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. for example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the argentine ant, pavement ant, yellow crazy ant, banded sugar ant, pharaoh ant, red ant, carpenter ant, odorous house ant, red imported fire ant, and european fire ant. some ants will raid stored food, some will seek water sources, others may damage indoor structures, some may damage agricultural crops directly (or by aiding sucking pests). some will sting or bite.[186] the adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. ant populations are managed by a combination of approaches that make use of chemical, biological, and physical methods. chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis. management is based on the species and techniques may vary according to the location and circumstance.[186] observed by humans since the dawn of history, the behaviour of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. those using scientific methods, myrmecologists, study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions. their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal model organisms. ultraviolet vision was first discovered in ants by sir john lubbock in 1881.[187] studies on ants have tested hypotheses in ecology and sociobiology, and have been particularly important in examining the predictions of theories of kin selection and evolutionarily stable strategies.[188] ant colonies may be studied by rearing or temporarily maintaining them in formicaria, specially constructed glass framed enclosures.[189] individuals may be tracked for study by marking them with dots of colours.[190] the successful techniques used by ant colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems, for example ant colony optimization and ant robotics. this area of biomimetics has led to studies of ant locomotion, search engines that make use of ""foraging trails"", fault-tolerant storage, and networking algorithms.[191] from the late 1950s through the late 1970s, ant farms were popular educational children's toys in the united states. some later commercial versions use transparent gel instead of soil, allowing greater visibility at the cost of stressing the ants with unnatural light.[192] anthropomorphised ants have often been used in fables and children's stories to represent industriousness and cooperative effort. they also are mentioned in religious texts.[193][194] in the book of proverbs in the bible, ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation.[195] aesop did the same in his fable the ant and the grasshopper. in the quran, sulayman is said to have heard and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by sulayman and his marching army.[quran 27:18][196] in parts of africa, ants are considered to be the messengers of the deities. some native american mythology, such as the hopi mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. ant bites are often said to have curative properties. the sting of some species of pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief.[197] ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some amazon indian cultures as a test of endurance.[198][199] ant society has always fascinated humans and has been written about both humorously and seriously. mark twain wrote about ants in his 1880 book a tramp abroad.[200] some modern authors have used the example of the ants to comment on the relationship between society and the individual. examples are robert frost in his poem ""departmental"" and t. h. white in his fantasy novel the once and future king. the plot in french entomologist and writer bernard werber's les fourmis science-fiction trilogy is divided between the worlds of ants and humans; ants and their behaviour is described using contemporary scientific knowledge. h.g. wells wrote about intelligent ants destroying human settlements in brazil and threatening human civilization in his 1905 science-fiction short story, the empire of the ants. in more recent times, animated cartoons and 3-d animated films featuring ants have been produced including antz, a bug's life, the ant bully, the ant and the aardvark, ferdy the ant and atom ant. renowned myrmecologist e. o. wilson wrote a short story, ""trailhead"" in 2010 for the new yorker magazine, which describes the life and death of an ant-queen and the rise and fall of her colony, from an ants' point of view.[201] the french neuroanatomist, psychiatrist and eugenicist auguste forel believed that ant societies were models for human society. he published a five volume work from 1921 to 1923 that examined ant biology and society.[202] in the early 1990s, the video game simant, which simulated an ant colony, won the 1992 codie award for ""best simulation program"".[203] ants also are quite popular inspiration for many science-fiction insectoids, such as the formics of ender's game, the bugs of starship troopers, the giant ants in the films them! and empire of the ants, marvel comics' super hero ant-man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in phase iv. in computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the klackons in the master of orion series of games or the chcht in deadlock ii. these characters are often credited with a hive mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.[204] "
dolphin," dolphin is a common name of aquatic mammals within the infraorder cetacea. the term dolphin usually refers to the extant families delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), platanistidae (the indian river dolphins), iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct lipotidae (baiji or chinese river dolphin). there are 40 extant species named as dolphins. dolphins range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) long and 50-kilogram (110-pound) maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 10-tonne (11-short-ton) orca. several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than females. they have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can travel at speeds 29 km/h (18 mph) for short distances.[1] dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. they have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. they have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water. although dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates. due to their largely social nature, dolphins often travel and hunt in a group, known as a diddle. dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the orca, feed on large mammals, like seals. male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles. dolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as japan, in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, habitat loss, and marine pollution. dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. dolphins occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the film series free willy. dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks. the most common dolphin species in captivity is the bottlenose dolphin, while there are around 60 captive orcas. the name is originally from greek δελφίς (delphís), ""dolphin"",[2] which was related to the greek δελφύς (delphus), ""womb"".[2] the animal's name can therefore be interpreted as meaning ""a 'fish' with a womb"".[3] the name was transmitted via the latin delphinus[4] (the romanization of the later greek δελφῖνος – delphinos[2]), which in medieval latin became dolfinus and in old french daulphin, which reintroduced the ph into the word. the term mereswine (that is, ""sea pig"") has also historically been used.[5] the term 'dolphin' can be used to refer to, under the parvorder odontoceti, all the species in the family delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) and the river dolphin families iniidae (south american river dolphins), pontoporiidae (la plata dolphin), lipotidae (yangtze river dolphin) and platanistidae (ganges river dolphin and indus river dolphin).[6][7] this term has often been misused in the us, mainly in the fishing industry, where all small cetaceans (dolphins and porpoises) are considered porpoises,[8] while the fish dorado is called dolphin fish.[9] in common usage the term 'whale' is used only for the larger cetacean species,[10] while the smaller ones with a beaked or longer nose are considered 'dolphins'.[11] the name 'dolphin' is used casually as a synonym for bottlenose dolphin, the most common and familiar species of dolphin.[12] there are six species of dolphins commonly thought of as whales, collectively known as blackfish: the orca, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy orca, the false orca, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family delphinidae and qualify as dolphins.[13] though the terms 'dolphin' and 'porpoise' are sometimes used interchangeably, porpoises are not considered dolphins and have different physical features such as a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth; they also differ in their behavior. porpoises belong to the family phocoenidae and share a common ancestry with the delphinidae.[12] a group of dolphins is called a ""school"" or a ""pod"". male dolphins are called ""bulls"", females ""cows"" and young dolphins are called ""calves"".[14] in 1933, three hybrid dolphins beached off the irish coast; they were hybrids between risso's and bottlenose dolphins.[16] this mating was later repeated in captivity, producing a hybrid calf. in captivity, a bottlenose and a rough-toothed dolphin produced hybrid offspring.[17] a common-bottlenose hybrid lives at seaworld california.[18] other dolphin hybrids live in captivity around the world or have been reported in the wild, such as a bottlenose-atlantic spotted hybrid.[19] the best known hybrid is the wolphin, a false orca-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. the wolphin is a fertile hybrid. two wolphins currently live at the sea life park in hawaii; the first was born in 1985 from a male false orca and a female bottlenose. wolphins have also been observed in the wild.[20] dolphins are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). they are related to the indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.[21][22] the primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5–10 million years later.[23] archaeoceti is a parvorder comprising ancient whales. these ancient whales are the predecessors of modern whales, stretching back to their first ancestor that spent their lives near (rarely in) the water. likewise, the archaeocetes can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete is the presence of visible legs or asymmetrical teeth.[24][25][26][27] their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. major anatomical changes include the hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone which occurred with ambulocetus 49 million years ago, a streamlining of the body and the growth of flukes on the tail which occurred around 43 million years ago with protocetus, the migration of the nasal openings toward the top of the cranium and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers which occurred with basilosaurus 35 million years ago, and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs which took place with the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 million years ago.[28][29][30] the modern dolphin skeleton has two small, rod-shaped pelvic bones thought to be vestigial hind limbs. in october 2006, an unusual bottlenose dolphin was captured in japan; it had small fins on each side of its genital slit, which scientists believe to be an unusually pronounced development of these vestigial hind limbs.[31] today, the closest living relatives of cetaceans are the hippopotamuses; these share a semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 million years ago.[32] around 40 million years ago, a common ancestor between the two branched off into cetacea and anthracotheres; anthracotheres became extinct at the end of the pleistocene two-and-a-half million years ago, eventually leaving only one surviving lineage: the hippo.[33][34] dolphins have torpedo-shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head; they lack external ear flaps. dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) long and 50 kg (110 lb) maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 10 t (11 short tons) orca. overall, however, they tend to be dwarfed by other cetartiodactyls. several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males.[35][36] dolphins have conical teeth, as opposed to porpoises' spade-shaped teeth. these conical teeth are used to catch swift prey such as fish, squid or large mammals, such as seal.[36] breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, in an upward blast, which may be visible in cold air, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. dolphins have rather small, unidentifiable spouts.[36][37] all dolphins have a thick layer of blubber, thickness varying on climate. this blubber can help with buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. calves, generally, are born with a thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on the habitat.[36][38] dolphins have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. they have fundic and pyloric chambers.[39] dolphins' reproductive organs are located inside the body, with genital slits on the ventral (belly) side. males have two slits, one concealing the penis and one further behind for the anus.[40] females have one genital slit, housing the vagina and the anus, with a mammary slit on either side.[41][42][43] the integumentary system is an organ system mostly consisted of skin, hair, nails and endocrine glands. the skin of dolphins is very important as it is specialized to satisfy specific requirements. some of these requirements include protection, fat storage, heat regulation, and sensory perception. the skin of a dolphin is made up of two parts: the epidermis and the blubber, which consists of two layers including the dermis and subcutis.[44] the dolphin's skin is known to have a smooth rubber texture and is without hair and glands, except mammary glands. at birth, a newborn dolphin has hairs lined up in a single band on both sides of the rostrum, which is their jaw, and usually have a total length of 16-17 cm .[44] dolphins are a part of the species cetacea. the epidermis of this species is characterized by the lack of keratin and by a prominent intertwine of epidermal rete pegs and long dermal papillae.[44] the epidermal rete pegs are the epithelial extensions that project into the underlying connective tissue in both skin and mucous membranes. the dermal papillae are finger-like projections that help adhesion between the epidermal and dermal layers, as well as providing a larger surface area to nourish the epidermal layer.[45] the thickness of a dolphin's epidermis differs, depending on species and age. blubber is found within the dermis and subcutis layer. the dermis blends gradually with the adipose layer, which is known as fat, because the fat may extend up to the epidermis border and collagen fiber bundles extend throughout the whole subcutaneous blubber which is fat found under the skin.[44] the thickness of the subcutaneous blubber or fat depends on the dolphin's health, development, location, reproductive state and how well it feeds. this fat is thickest on the dolphin's back and belly. most of the dolphin's body fat is accumulated in a thick layer of blubber. blubber differs from fat in that, in addition to fat cells, it contains a fibrous network of connective tissue.[46] the blubber functions to streamline the body and to form specialized locomotor structures such as the dorsal fin, propulsive fluke blades and caudal keels.[44] there are many nerve endings that resemble small, onion-like configurations that are present in the superficial portion of the dermis. mechanoreceptors are found within the interlocks of the epidermis with dermal ridges. there are nerve fibers in the dermis that extend to the epidermis. these nerve endings are known to be highly proprioceptive, which explains sensory perception.[44] proprioception, which is also known as kinesthesia, is the body's ability to sense its location, movements and actions.[47] dolphins are sensitive to vibrations and small pressure changes. blood vessels and nerve endings can be found within the dermis. there is a plexus of parallel running arteries and veins in the dorsal fin, fluke and flippers.[44] the blubber manipulates the blood vessels to help the dolphin stay warm. when the temperature drops, the blubber constricts the blood vessels to reduce blood flow in the dolphin.[48] this allows the dolphin to spend less energy heating its own body, ultimately keeping the animal warmer without burning energy as quick. in order to release heat, the heat must pass the blubber layer. there are thermal windows that lack blubber, are not fully insulated and are somewhat thin and highly vascularized, including the dorsal fin, flukes, and flippers.[49] these thermal windows are a good way for dolphins to get rid of excess heat if overheating. additionally in order to conserve heat, dolphins use countercurrent heat exchange. blood flows in different directions in order for heat to transfer across membranes. heat from warm blood leaving the heart will heat up the cold blood that is headed back to the heart from the extremities, meaning that the heart always has warm blood and it decreases the heat lost to the water in those thermal windows.[49] dolphins have two pectoral flippers, containing four digits, a boneless dorsal fin for stability, and a tail fin for propulsion. although dolphins do not possess external hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. dolphins are fast swimmers in comparison to seals which typically cruise at 9–28 km/h (5.6–17.4 mph); the orca (orca), in comparison, can travel at speeds up to 55.5 km/h (34.5 mph). the fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, which means they are unable to turn their heads.[50][51] river dolphins, however, have non-fused neck vertebrae and are able to turn their head up to 90°.[52] dolphins swim by moving their tail fin and rear body vertically, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. some species log out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. all species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from involuntarily spinning in the water.[36][38] some dolphins are adapted for diving to great depths. in addition to their streamlined bodies, some can slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen. some can also re-route blood from tissue tolerant of water pressure to the heart, brain and other organs. their hemoglobin and myoglobin store oxygen in body tissues and they have twice the concentration of myoglobin than hemoglobin.[53] the dolphin ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. in humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. in dolphins, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. the dolphin ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater.[54] dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. this melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. this allows dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation.[36][55][56][57][58] though most dolphins do not have hair, they do have hair follicles that may perform some sensory function.[59] beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on an object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood.[60] the small hairs on the rostrum of the boto are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for the boto's poor eyesight.[61] the dolphin eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. as well as this, the eyes of a dolphin are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. when dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. dolphins do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for color vision than most mammals.[62] most dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. they also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.[55] the olfactory lobes are absent in dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.[55] dolphins are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. however, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.[55] dolphins are often regarded as one of earth's most intelligent animals. comparing species' relative intelligence is complicated by differences in sensory apparatus, response modes, and nature of cognition. furthermore, the difficulty and expense of experimental work with large aquatic animals has so far prevented some tests and limited sample size and rigor in others. compared to many other species, however, dolphin behavior has been studied extensively, both in captivity and in the wild. see cetacean intelligence for more details. dolphins are highly social animals, often living in pods of up to a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and structures vary greatly between species and locations. in places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. dolphins can, however, establish strong social bonds; they will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed.[63] this altruism does not appear to be limited to their own species. the dolphin moko in new zealand has been observed guiding a female pygmy sperm whale together with her calf out of shallow water where they had stranded several times.[64] they have also been seen protecting swimmers from sharks by swimming circles around the swimmers[65][66] or charging the sharks to make them go away. dolphins communicate using a variety of clicks, whistle-like sounds and other vocalizations. dolphins also use nonverbal communication by means of touch and posturing.[67] dolphins also display culture, something long believed to be unique to humans (and possibly other primate species). in may 2005, a discovery in australia found indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins (tursiops aduncus) teaching their young to use tools. they cover their snouts with sponges to protect them while foraging. this knowledge is mostly transferred by mothers to daughters, unlike simian primates, where knowledge is generally passed on to both sexes. using sponges as mouth protection is a learned behavior.[68] another learned behavior was discovered among river dolphins in brazil, where some male dolphins use weeds and sticks as part of a sexual display.[69] forms of care-giving between fellows and even for members of different species[70] (see moko (dolphin)) are recorded in various species – such as trying to save weakened fellows[71] or female pilot whales holding up dead calves for long periods. dolphins engage in acts of aggression towards each other. the older a male dolphin is, the more likely his body is to be covered with bite scars. male dolphins can get into disputes over companions and females. acts of aggression can become so intense that targeted dolphins sometimes go into exile after losing a fight. male bottlenose dolphins have been known to engage in infanticide. dolphins have also been known to kill porpoises for reasons which are not fully understood, as porpoises generally do not share the same diet as dolphins and are therefore not competitors for food supplies.[72] the cornwall wildlife trust records about one such death a year. possible explanations include misdirected infanticide, misdirected sexual aggression or play behaviour.[73] dolphin copulation happens belly to belly; though many species engage in lengthy foreplay, the actual act is usually brief, but may be repeated several times within a short timespan.[74] the gestation period varies with species; for the small tucuxi dolphin, this period is around 11 to 12 months,[75] while for the orca, the gestation period is around 17 months.[76] typically dolphins give birth to a single calf, which is, unlike most other mammals, born tail first in most cases.[77] they usually become sexually active at a young age, even before reaching sexual maturity.[74] the age of sexual maturity varies by species and gender.[78] dolphins are known to display non-reproductive sexual behavior, engaging in masturbation, stimulation of the genital area of other individuals using the rostrum or flippers, and homosexual contact.[74][79][80] various species of dolphin have been known to engage in sexual behavior up to and including copulation with dolphins of other species. sexual encounters may be violent, with male dolphins sometimes showing aggressive behavior towards both females and other males.[81] male dolphins may also work together and attempt to herd females in estrus, keeping the females by their side by means of both physical aggression and intimidation, to increase their chances of reproductive success.[82] occasionally, dolphins behave sexually towards other animals, including humans.[83][84] there are various feeding methods among and within species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. fish and squid are the main food, but the false orca and the orca also feed on other marine mammals. orcas on occasion also hunt whale species larger than themselves.[85] different breeds of dolphins vary widely in the number of teeth they possess. the orca or orca usually carries 40-56 teeth while the popular bottlenose dolphin has anywhere from 72 to 116 conical teeth and its smaller cousin the common dolphin has 188-268 teeth so that the number of teeth each breed carries varies widely between individuals. hybrids between common and bottlenose bred in captivity had an intermediate amount of teeth. one common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish.[85] coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily.[85] orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behaviour known as beach or strand feeding.[86][87] some species also whack fish with their flukes, stunning them and sometimes knocking them out of the water.[85] reports of cooperative human-dolphin fishing date back to the ancient roman author and natural philosopher pliny the elder.[88] a modern human-dolphin partnership currently operates in laguna, santa catarina, brazil. here, dolphins drive fish towards fishermen waiting along the shore and signal the men to cast their nets. the dolphins' reward is the fish that escape the nets.[89][90] in shark bay, australia, dolphins catch fish by trapping them in huge conch shells.[91] in ""shelling"", a dolphin brings the shell to the surface and shakes it, so that fish sheltering within fall into the dolphin's mouth. from 2007 to 2018, in 5,278 encounters with dolphins, researchers observed 19 dolphins shelling 42 times. the behavior spreads mainly within generations, rather than being passed from mother to offspring. dolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. roughly three categories of sounds can be identified: frequency modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds and clicks. dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function,[92] and through burst-pulsed sounds, though the nature and extent of that ability is not known. the clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. the click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.[93] bottlenose dolphins have been found to have signature whistles, a whistle that is unique to a specific individual. these whistles are used in order for dolphins to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. it can be seen as the dolphin equivalent of a name for humans.[94] these signature whistles are developed during a dolphin's first year; it continues to maintain the same sound throughout its lifetime.[95] in order to obtain each individual whistle sound, dolphins undergo vocal production learning. this consists of an experience with other dolphins that modifies the signal structure of an existing whistle sound. an auditory experience influences the whistle development of each dolphin. dolphins are able to communicate to one another by addressing another dolphin through mimicking their whistle. the signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more distinguishing.[96] bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years.[97] research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited. the research on other species done so far has yielded varied outcomes and inconclusive results.[98][99][100][101] because dolphins are generally associated in groups, communication is necessary. signal masking is when other similar sounds (conspecific sounds) interfere with the original acoustic sound.[102] in larger groups, individual whistle sounds are less prominent. dolphins tend to travel in pods, upon which there are groups of dolphins that range from a few to many. although they are traveling in these pods, the dolphins do not necessarily swim right next to each other. rather, they swim within the same general vicinity. in order to prevent losing one of their pod members, there are higher whistle rates. because their group members were spread out, this was done in order to continue traveling together. dolphins frequently leap above the water surface, this being done for various reasons. when travelling, jumping can save the dolphin energy as there is less friction while in the air.[103] this type of travel is known as porpoising.[103] other reasons include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites.[104][105] dolphins show various types of playful behavior, often including objects, self-made bubble rings, other dolphins or other animals.[7][106][107] when playing with objects or small animals, common behavior includes carrying the object or animal along using various parts of the body, passing it along to other members of the group or taking it from another member, or throwing it out of the water.[106] dolphins have also been observed harassing animals in other ways, for example by dragging birds underwater without showing any intent to eat them.[106] playful behaviour that involves another animal species with active participation of the other animal can also be observed however. playful human interaction with dolphins being the most obvious example, however playful interactions have been observed in the wild with a number of other species as well, such as humpback whales and dogs.[108][109] juvenile dolphins off the coast of western australia have been observed chasing, capturing, and chewing on blowfish.[110] while some reports state that the dolphins are becoming intoxicated on the tetrodotoxin in the fishes' skin,[111] other reports have characterized this behavior as the normal curiosity and exploration of their environment in which dolphins engage.[112] dolphins are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve.[113] the neocortex of many species is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids.[114] in humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgment, and theory of mind.[115] cetacean spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.[116] brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass.[117] comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalization quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. orcas have the second largest brain mass of any animal on earth, next to the sperm whale.[118] the brain to body mass ratio in some is second only to humans.[119] self-awareness is seen, by some, to be a sign of highly developed, abstract thinking. self-awareness, though not well-defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like meta-cognitive reasoning (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. research in this field has suggested that cetaceans, among others, possess self-awareness.[120] the most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the mirror test in which a mirror is introduced to an animal, and the animal is then marked with a temporary dye. if the animal then goes to the mirror in order to view the mark, it has exhibited strong evidence of self-awareness.[121] some disagree with these findings, arguing that the results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the clever hans effect. this test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. the researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.[121] in 1995, marten and psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness.[122] they showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. they concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. while this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test.[121] however, some researchers have argued that evidence for self-awareness has not been convincingly demonstrated.[123] generally, dolphins sleep with only one brain hemisphere in slow-wave sleep at a time, thus maintaining enough consciousness to breathe and to watch for possible predators and other threats. sleep stages earlier in sleep can occur simultaneously in both hemispheres.[124][125][126] in captivity, dolphins seemingly enter a fully asleep state where both eyes are closed and there is no response to mild external stimuli. in this case, respiration is automatic; a tail kick reflex keeps the blowhole above the water if necessary. anesthetized dolphins initially show a tail kick reflex.[127] though a similar state has been observed with wild sperm whales, it is not known if dolphins in the wild reach this state.[128] the indus river dolphin has a sleep method that is different from that of other dolphin species. living in water with strong currents and potentially dangerous floating debris, it must swim continuously to avoid injury. as a result, this species sleeps in very short bursts which last between 4 and 60 seconds.[129] dolphins have few marine enemies. some species or specific populations have none, making them apex predators. for most of the smaller species of dolphins, only a few of the larger sharks, such as the bull shark, dusky shark, tiger shark and great white shark, are a potential risk, especially for calves.[130] some of the larger dolphin species, especially orcas (orcas), may also prey on smaller dolphins, but this seems rare.[131] dolphins also suffer from a wide variety of diseases and parasites.[132][133] the cetacean morbillivirus in particular has been known to cause regional epizootics often leaving hundreds of animals of various species dead.[134][135] symptoms of infection are often a severe combination of pneumonia, encephalitis and damage to the immune system, which greatly impair the cetacean's ability to swim and stay afloat unassisted.[136][137] a study at the u.s. national marine mammal foundation revealed that dolphins, like humans, develop a natural form of type 2 diabetes which may lead to a better understanding of the disease and new treatments for both humans and dolphins.[138] dolphins can tolerate and recover from extreme injuries such as shark bites although the exact methods used to achieve this are not known. the healing process is rapid and even very deep wounds do not cause dolphins to hemorrhage to death. furthermore, even gaping wounds restore in such a way that the animal's body shape is restored, and infection of such large wounds seems rare.[139] a study published in the journal marine mammal science suggests that at least some dolphins survive shark attacks using everything from sophisticated combat moves to teaming up against the shark.[140][141][142] some dolphin species are at risk of extinction, especially some river dolphin species such as the amazon river dolphin, and the ganges and yangtze river dolphin, which are critically or seriously endangered. a 2006 survey found no individuals of the yangtze river dolphin, which now appears to be functionally extinct.[143] pesticides, heavy metals, plastics, and other industrial and agricultural pollutants that do not disintegrate rapidly in the environment concentrate in predators such as dolphins.[144] injuries or deaths due to collisions with boats, especially their propellers, are also common. various fishing methods, most notably purse seine fishing for tuna and the use of drift and gill nets, unintentionally kill many dolphins.[145] accidental by-catch in gill nets and incidental captures in antipredator nets that protect marine fish farms are common and pose a risk for mainly local dolphin populations.[146][147] in some parts of the world, such as taiji in japan and the faroe islands, dolphins are traditionally considered food and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts.[148] dolphin meat is high in mercury and may thus pose a health danger to humans when consumed.[149] queensland's shark culling program, which has killed roughly 50,000 sharks since 1962, has also killed thousands of dolphins as bycatch.[150][151] ""shark control"" programs in both queensland and new south wales use shark nets and drum lines, which entangle and kill dolphins.[152] queensland's ""shark control"" program has killed more than 1,000 dolphins in recent years,[151] and at least 32 dolphins have been killed in queensland since 2014.[153] a shark culling program in kwazulu-natal has killed at least 2,310 dolphins.[154] dolphin safe labels attempt to reassure consumers that fish and other marine products have been caught in a dolphin-friendly way. the earliest campaigns with ""dolphin safe"" labels were initiated in the 1980s as a result of cooperation between marine activists and the major tuna companies, and involved decreasing incidental dolphin kills by up to 50% by changing the type of nets used to catch tuna. the dolphins are netted only while fishermen are in pursuit of smaller tuna. albacore are not netted this way, making albacore the only truly dolphin-safe tuna.[155] loud underwater noises, such as those resulting from naval sonar use, live firing exercises, and certain offshore construction projects such as wind farms, may be harmful to dolphins, increasing stress, damaging hearing, and causing decompression sickness by forcing them to surface too quickly to escape the noise.[156][157] dolphins and other smaller cetaceans are also hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. this is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the solomon islands, the faroe islands, peru, and japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. by numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year. dolphins have long played a role in human culture. dolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry. in greek myths, dolphins were seen invariably as helpers of humankind. dolphins also seem to have been important to the minoans, judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at knossos. during the 2009 excavations of a major mycenaean city at iklaina, a striking fragment of a wall-paintings came to light, depicting a ship with three human figures and dolphins. dolphins are common in greek mythology, and many coins from ancient greece have been found which feature a man, a boy or a deity riding on the back of a dolphin.[158] the ancient greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship's wake was considered a good omen.[159] in both ancient and later art, cupid is often shown riding a dolphin. a dolphin rescued the poet arion from drowning and carried him safe to land, at cape matapan, a promontory forming the southernmost point of the peloponnesus. there was a temple to poseidon and a statue of arion riding the dolphin.[160] the greeks reimagined the phoenician god melqart as melikertês (melicertes) and made him the son of athamas and ino. he drowned but was transfigured as the marine deity palaemon, while his mother became leucothea. (cf ino.) at corinth, he was so closely connected with the cult of poseidon that the isthmian games, originally instituted in poseidon's honor, came to be looked upon as the funeral games of melicertes. phalanthus was another legendary character brought safely to shore (in italy) on the back of a dolphin, according to pausanias. dionysus was once captured by etruscan pirates who mistook him for a wealthy prince they could ransom. after the ship set sail dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been. he turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but dionysus took pity on them and transformed them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need. dolphins were also the messengers of poseidon and sometimes did errands for him as well. dolphins were sacred to both aphrodite and apollo. when heraldry developed in the middle ages, not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted as a sort of fish. traditionally, the stylised dolphins in heraldry still may take after this notion, sometimes showing the dolphin skin covered with fish scales. dolphins are present in the coat of arms of anguilla and the coat of arms of romania,[161] and the coat of arms of barbados has a dolphin supporter.[162][163] a well-known historical example of a dolphin in heraldry, was the arms for the former province of the dauphiné in southern france, from which were derived the arms and the title of the dauphin of france, the heir to the former throne of france (the title literally means ""the dolphin of france""). ""dolfin"" was the name of an aristocratic family in the maritime republic of venice, whose most prominent member was the 13th century doge giovanni dolfin. in hindu mythology the ganges river dolphin is associated with ganga, the deity of the ganges river. the dolphin is said to be among the creatures which heralded the goddess' descent from the heavens and her mount, the makara, is sometimes depicted as a dolphin.[164] the boto, a species of river dolphin that resides in the amazon river, are believed to be shapeshifters, or encantados, who are capable of having children with human women. there are comparatively few surviving myths of dolphins in polynesian cultures, in spite of their maritime traditions and relevance of other marine animals such as sharks and seabirds; unlike these, they are more often perceived as food than as totemic symbols. dolphins are most clearly represented in rapa nui rongorongo, and in the traditions of the caroline islands they are depicted similarly to the boto, being sexually active shapeshifters.[165] the renewed popularity of dolphins in the 1960s resulted in the appearance of many dolphinaria around the world, making dolphins accessible to the public. criticism and animal welfare laws forced many to close, although hundreds still exist around the world. in the united states, the best known are the seaworld marine mammal parks. in the middle east the best known are dolphin bay at atlantis, the palm[166] and the dubai dolphinarium.[167] various species of dolphins are kept in captivity. these small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as seaworld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. other species kept in captivity are spotted dolphins, false orcas and common dolphins, commerson's dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. there are also fewer than ten pilot whales, amazon river dolphins, risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi in captivity.[168] an unusual and very rare hybrid dolphin, known as a wolphin, is kept at the sea life park in hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a false orca.[169] the number of orcas kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with 60 captive orcas being held in aquaria as of 2017[update].[170] the orca's intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. from 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in iceland, 19 from japan, and three from argentina. these figures exclude animals that died during capture. live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.[38] organizations such as the mote marine laboratory rescue and rehabilitate sick, wounded, stranded or orphaned dolphins while others, such as the whale and dolphin conservation and hong kong dolphin conservation society, work on dolphin conservation and welfare. india has declared the dolphin as its national aquatic animal in an attempt to protect the endangered ganges river dolphin. the vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary has been created in the ganges river for the protection of the animals.[171] there is debate over the welfare of cetaceans in captivity, and often welfare can vary greatly dependent on the levels of care being provided at a particular facility. in the united states, facilities are regularly inspected by federal agencies to ensure that a high standard of welfare is maintained.[citation needed] additionally, facilities can apply to become accredited by the association of zoos and aquariums (aza), which (for accreditation) requires ""the highest standards of animal care and welfare in the world"" to be achieved. facilities such as seaworld and the georgia aquarium are accredited by the aza. organizations such as world animal protection and the whale and dolphin conservation campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. in captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of male orcas. captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s, although there are examples of orcas living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas, corky ii and lolita, are in their mid-40s. in the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years.[172] captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild orca behavior. wild orcas may travel up to 160 kilometres (100 mi) in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity.[173] captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress.[174] although dolphins generally interact well with humans, some attacks have occurred, most of them resulting in small injuries.[175] orcas, the largest species of dolphin, have been involved in fatal attacks on humans in captivity. the record-holder of documented orca fatal attacks is a male named tilikum,[176][177][178] who lived at seaworld from 1992 until his death in 2017.[179] tilikum has played a role in the death of three people in three different incidents (1991, 1999 and 2010).[180] tilikum's behaviour sparked the production of the documentary blackfish, which focuses on the consequences of keeping orcas in captivity. there are documented incidents in the wild, too, but none of them fatal.[181] fatal attacks from other species are less common, but there is a registered occurrence off the coast of brazil in 1994, when a man died after being attacked by a bottlenose dolphin named tião.[182][183] tião had suffered harassment by human visitors, including attempts to stick ice cream sticks down her blowhole.[184] non-fatal incidents occur more frequently, both in the wild and in captivity. while dolphin attacks occur far less frequently than attacks by other sea animals, such as sharks, some scientists are worried about the careless programs of human-dolphin interaction. dr. andrew j. read, a biologist at the duke university marine laboratory who studies dolphin attacks, points out that dolphins are large and wild predators, so people should be more careful when they interact with them.[175] several scientists who have researched dolphin behaviour have proposed that dolphins' unusually high intelligence in comparison to other animals means that dolphins should be seen as non-human persons who should have their own specific rights and that it is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purposes or to kill them either intentionally for consumption or unintentionally as by-catch.[185][186] four countries – chile, costa rica, hungary, and india – have declared dolphins to be ""non-human persons"" and have banned the capture and import of live dolphins for entertainment.[187][188][189] a number of militaries have employed dolphins for various purposes from finding mines to rescuing lost or trapped humans. the military use of dolphins, however, drew scrutiny during the vietnam war when rumors circulated that the united states navy was training dolphins to kill vietnamese divers.[190] the united states navy denies that at any point dolphins were trained for combat. dolphins are still being trained by the united states navy for other tasks as part of the u.s. navy marine mammal program. the russian military is believed to have closed its marine mammal program in the early 1990s. in 2000 the press reported that dolphins trained to kill by the soviet navy had been sold to iran.[191] the military is also interested in disguising underwater communications as artificial dolphin clicks.[192] dolphins are an increasingly popular choice of animal-assisted therapy for psychological problems and developmental disabilities. for example, a 2005 study found dolphins an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression.[193] however, this study was criticized on several grounds. for example, it is not known whether dolphins are more effective than common pets.[194] reviews of this and other published dolphin-assisted therapy (dat) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that dat is a legitimate therapy or that it affords more than fleeting mood improvement.[195] in some parts of the world, such as taiji, japan and the faroe islands, dolphins are traditionally considered as food, and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts.[196] dolphin meat is consumed in a small number of countries worldwide, which include japan[197] and peru (where it is referred to as chancho marino, or ""sea pork"").[198] while japan may be the best-known and most controversial example, only a very small minority of the population has ever sampled it. dolphin meat is dense and such a dark shade of red as to appear black. fat is located in a layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. when dolphin meat is eaten in japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either horseradish or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat (basashi). when cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to beef liver.[199] there have been human health concerns associated with the consumption of dolphin meat in japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of mercury.[200] there are no known cases of mercury poisoning as a result of consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. the japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis.[201] similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the faroe islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and pcbs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.[200] the faroe islands population was exposed to methylmercury largely from contaminated pilot whale meat, which contained very high levels of about 2 mg methylmercury/kg. however, the faroe islands populations also eat

bee," apiformes (from latin 'apis') bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey. bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily apoidea. they are presently considered a clade, called anthophila. there are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families.[1][2] some species – including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees – live socially in colonies while some species – including mason bees, carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, and sweat bees – are solitary. bees are found on every continent except for antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants. the most common bees in the northern hemisphere are the halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species, whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long, to megachile pluto, the largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54 in). bees feed on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. most pollen is used as food for their larvae. vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies. bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially, and the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees. the analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.[3] human beekeeping or apiculture has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of ancient egypt and ancient greece. bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature from ancient times to the present day, although primarily focused in the northern hemisphere where beekeeping is far more common. the ancestors of bees were wasps in the family crabronidae, which were predators of other insects. the switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. this same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasps, where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors. until recently, the oldest non-compression bee fossil had been found in new jersey amber, cretotrigona prisca of cretaceous age, a corbiculate bee.[4] a bee fossil from the early cretaceous (~100 mya), melittosphex burmensis, is considered ""an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting apoidea sister to the modern bees"".[5] derived features of its morphology (apomorphies) place it clearly within the bees, but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits (plesiomorphies) of the legs (two mid-tibial spurs, and a slender hind basitarsus), showing its transitional status.[5] by the eocene (~45 mya) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages.[6][a] the highly eusocial corbiculate apidae appeared roughly 87 mya, and the allodapini (within the apidae) around 53 mya.[9] the colletidae appear as fossils only from the late oligocene (~25 mya) to early miocene.[10] the melittidae are known from palaeomacropis eocenicus in the early eocene.[11] the megachilidae are known from trace fossils (characteristic leaf cuttings) from the middle eocene.[12] the andrenidae are known from the eocene-oligocene boundary, around 34 mya, of the florissant shale.[13] the halictidae first appear in the early eocene[14] with species[15][16] found in amber. the stenotritidae are known from fossil brood cells of pleistocene age.[17] the earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow, cup-shaped blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees. the novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. in a process of coevolution, flowers developed floral rewards[18] such as nectar and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar.[19] bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen. the location and type differ among and between groups of bees. most species have scopal hairs on their hind legs or on the underside of their abdomens. some species in the family apidae have pollen baskets on their hind legs, while very few lack these and instead collect pollen in their crops.[2] the appearance of these structures drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms, and, in turn, bees themselves.[7] bees coevolved not only with flowers but it is believed that some species coevolved with mites. some provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc.[20][21] this phylogenetic tree is based on debevic et al, 2012, which used molecular phylogeny to demonstrate that the bees (anthophila) arose from deep within the crabronidae, which is therefore paraphyletic. the placement of the heterogynaidae is uncertain.[22] the small subfamily mellininae was not included in this analysis. ampulicidae (cockroach wasps) heterogynaidae (possible placement #1) sphecidae (sensu stricto) crabroninae (part of ""crabronidae"") bembicini nyssonini, astatinae heterogynaidae (possible placement #2) pemphredoninae, philanthinae anthophila (bees) this cladogram of the bee families is based on hedtke et al., 2013, which places the former families dasypodaidae and meganomiidae as subfamilies inside the melittidae.[23] english names, where available, are given in parentheses. melittidae (inc. dasypodainae, meganomiinae) at least 50 mya apidae (inc. honeybees, cuckoo bees, carpenter bees) ≈87 mya megachilidae (mason, leafcutter bees) ≈50 mya andrenidae (mining bees) ≈34 mya halictidae (sweat bees) ≈50 mya colletidae (plasterer bees) ≈25 mya stenotritidae (large australian bees) ≈2 mya bees differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (hairs), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in limb structure, and the venation of the hind wings; and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.[24] bees have the following characteristics: the largest species of bee is thought to be wallace's giant bee megachile pluto, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54 in).[26] the smallest species may be dwarf stingless bees in the tribe meliponini whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) in length.[27] according to inclusive fitness theory, organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also that of close relatives. in evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when cost < relatedness * benefit. the requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure.[28] in haplodiploid species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs. because a male is haploid (has only one copy of each gene), his daughters (which are diploid, with two copies of each gene) share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. this mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what w. d. hamilton termed ""supersisters"", more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring.[29] workers often do not reproduce, but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters (as queens) than they would by having their own offspring (each of which would only have 50% of their genes), assuming they would produce similar numbers. this unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple (at least 9) evolutions of eusociality within hymenoptera.[30][31] haplodiploidy is neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality. some eusocial species such as termites are not haplodiploid. conversely, all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters that share only 25% of each-other's genes.[32] but, monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated, so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees.[30] bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities. eusociality appears to have originated from at least three independent origins in halictid bees.[33] the most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies; these are characterised by cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations.[34] this division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes. in some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, and if there is a division of labour within the group, they are considered semisocial. the group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers). when the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many paper wasps; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.[19] true honey bees (genus apis, of which seven species are currently recognized) are highly eusocial, and are among the best known insects. their colonies are established by swarms, consisting of a queen and several hundred workers. there are 29 subspecies of one of these species, apis mellifera, native to europe, the middle east, and africa. africanized bees are a hybrid strain of a. mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing european and african subspecies; they are extremely defensive.[35] stingless bees are also highly eusocial. they practise mass provisioning, with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies also established via swarming.[36] many bumblebees are eusocial, similar to the eusocial vespidae such as hornets in that the queen initiates a nest on her own rather than by swarming. bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 bees at peak population, which occurs in mid to late summer. nest architecture is simple, limited by the size of the pre-existing nest cavity, and colonies rarely last more than a year.[37] in 2011, the international union for conservation of nature set up the bumblebee specialist group to review the threat status of all bumblebee species worldwide using the iucn red list criteria.[38] there are many more species of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bees, but they have been studied less often. most are in the family halictidae, or ""sweat bees"". colonies are typically small, with a dozen or fewer workers, on average. queens and workers differ only in size, if at all. most species have a single season colony cycle, even in the tropics, and only mated females hibernate. a few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds, such as halictus hesperus.[39] some species are eusocial in parts of their range and solitary in others,[40] or have a mix of eusocial and solitary nests in the same population.[41] the orchid bees (apidae) include some primitively eusocial species with similar biology. some allodapine bees (apidae) form primitively eusocial colonies, with progressive provisioning: a larva's food is supplied gradually as it develops, as is the case in honey bees and some bumblebees.[42] most other bees, including familiar insects such as carpenter bees, leafcutter bees and mason bees are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. there is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species. solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax. bees collect pollen to feed their young, and have the necessary adaptations to do this. however, certain wasp species such as pollen wasps have similar behaviours, and a few species of bee scavenge from carcases to feed their offspring.[24] solitary bees are important pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste-like consistency. some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. very few species of solitary bee are being cultured for commercial pollination. most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences, namely: carpenter bees, sweat bees, mason bees, plasterer bees, squash bees, dwarf carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, alkali bees and digger bees.[43] most solitary bees nest in the ground in a variety of soil textures and conditions while others create nests in hollow reeds or twigs, holes in wood. the female typically creates a compartment (a ""cell"") with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva, then seals it off. a nest may consist of numerous cells. when the nest is in wood, usually the last (those closer to the entrance) contain eggs that will become males. the adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid, and usually dies after making one or more nests. the males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge. solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting (only in self-defense, if ever).[44][45] while solitary, females each make individual nests.[46] some species, such as the european mason bee hoplitis anthocopoides,[47] and the dawson's burrowing bee, amegilla dawsoni,[48] are gregarious, preferring to make nests near others of the same species, and giving the appearance of being social. large groups of solitary bee nests are called aggregations, to distinguish them from colonies. in some species, multiple females share a common nest, but each makes and provisions her own cells independently. this type of group is called ""communal"" and is not uncommon. the primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when multiple females use that same entrance regularly.[47] the life cycle of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, involves the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed by the emergence of a winged adult. most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. the males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. the sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.[49][50][51][52] the egg is generally oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. solitary bees, lay each egg in a separate cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. this may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. social bee species provision progressively, that is, they feed the larva regularly while it grows. the nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.[53] in most species, larvae are whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. they have 15 segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. they have no legs but move within the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. they have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. there is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce a cocoon. the cocoon is semi-transparent and the pupa can be seen through it. over the course of a few days, the larva undergoes metamorphosis into a winged adult. when ready to emerge, the adult splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae and breaks out of the cell.[53] nest of common carder bumblebee, wax canopy removed to show winged workers and pupae in irregularly placed wax cells carpenter bee nests in a cedar wood beam (sawn open) honeybees on brood comb with eggs and larvae in cells antoine magnan's 1934 book le vol des insectes, says that he and andré sainte-laguë had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed-wing calculations, but that ""one shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality"".[54] this has led to a common misconception that bees ""violate aerodynamic theory"". in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in fixed-wing flight, and that their flight is explained by other mechanics, such as those used by helicopters.[55] in 1996 it was shown that vortices created by many insects' wings helped to provide lift.[56] high-speed cinematography[57] and robotic mock-up of a bee wing[58] showed that lift was generated by ""the unconventional combination of short, choppy wing strokes, a rapid rotation of the wing as it flops over and reverses direction, and a very fast wing-beat frequency"". wing-beat frequency normally increases as size decreases, but as the bee's wing beat covers such a small arc, it flaps approximately 230 times per second, faster than a fruitfly (200 times per second) which is 80 times smaller.[59] the ethologist karl von frisch studied navigation in the honey bee. he showed that honey bees communicate by the waggle dance, in which a worker indicates the location of a food source to other workers in the hive. he demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field. he showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive.[60] bees navigate using spatial memory with a ""rich, map-like organization"".[61] the gut of bees is relatively simple, but multiple metabolic strategies exist in the gut microbiota.[62] pollinating bees consume nectar and pollen, which require different digestion strategies by somewhat specialized bacteria. while nectar is a liquid of mostly monosaccharide sugars and so easily absorbed, pollen contains complex polysaccharides: branching pectin and hemicellulose.[63] approximately five groups of bacteria are involved in digestion. three groups specialize in simple sugars (snodgrassella and two groups of lactobacillus), and two other groups in complex sugars (gilliamella and bifidobacterium). digestion of pectin and hemicellulose is dominated by bacterial clades gilliamella and bifidobacterium respectively. bacteria that cannot digest polysaccharides obtain enzymes from their neighbors, and bacteria that lack certain amino acids do the same, creating multiple ecological niches.[64] although most bee species are nectarivorous and palynivorous, some are not. particularly unusual are vulture bees in the genus trigona, which consume carrion and wasp brood, turning meat into a honey-like substance.[65] most bees are polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen from a range of flowering plants, but some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants.[66] specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors,[67] and even electromagnetic fields.[68] once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality[67] and pollen taste[69] to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers. in rare cases, a plant species may only be effectively pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened. but, there is a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants visited by multiple pollinator species. for example, the creosote bush in the arid parts of the united states southwest is associated with some 40 oligoleges.[70] many bees are aposematically coloured, typically orange and black, warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting. as such they are models for batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects such as bee-flies, robber flies and hoverflies,[71] all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.[71] bees are themselves müllerian mimics of other aposematic insects with the same colour scheme, including wasps, lycid and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths (lepidoptera) which are themselves distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food. all the müllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration.[72] bees are also mimicked by plants such as the bee orchid which imitates both the appearance and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate (pseudocopulation) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.[73] brood parasites occur in several bee families including the apid subfamily nomadinae.[74] females of these species lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) and do not construct their own nests. they typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. when the ""cuckoo"" bee larva hatches, it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also.[75] in particular, the arctic bee species, bombus hyperboreus is an aggressive species that attacks and enslaves other bees of the same subgenus. however, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.[76] in southern africa, hives of african honeybees (a. mellifera scutellata) are being destroyed by parasitic workers of the cape honeybee, a. m. capensis. these lay diploid eggs (""thelytoky""), escaping normal worker policing, leading to the colony's destruction; the parasites can then move to other hives.[77] the cuckoo bees in the bombus subgenus psithyrus are closely related to, and resemble, their hosts in looks and size. this common pattern gave rise to the ecological principle ""emery's rule"". others parasitize bees in different families, like townsendiella, a nomadine apid, two species of which are cleptoparasites of the dasypodaid genus hesperapis,[78] while the other species in the same genus attacks halictid bees.[79] four bee families (andrenidae, colletidae, halictidae, and apidae) contain some species that are crepuscular. most are tropical or subtropical, but some live in arid regions at higher latitudes. these bees have greatly enlarged ocelli, which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.[80] vertebrate predators of bees include bee-eaters, shrikes and flycatchers, which make short sallies to catch insects in flight.[81] swifts and swallows[81] fly almost continually, catching insects as they go. the honey buzzard attacks bees' nests and eats the larvae.[82] the greater honeyguide interacts with humans by guiding them to the nests of wild bees. the humans break open the nests and take the honey and the bird feeds on the larvae and the wax.[83] among mammals, predators such as the badger dig up bumblebee nests and eat both the larvae and any stored food.[84] specialist ambush predators of visitors to flowers include crab spiders, which wait on flowering plants for pollinating insects; predatory bugs, and praying mantises,[81] some of which (the flower mantises of the tropics) wait motionless, aggressive mimics camouflaged as flowers.[85] beewolves are large wasps that habitually attack bees;[81] the ethologist niko tinbergen estimated that a single colony of the beewolf philanthus triangulum might kill several thousand honeybees in a day: all the prey he observed were honeybees.[86] other predatory insects that sometimes catch bees include robber flies and dragonflies.[81] honey bees are affected by parasites including acarine and varroa mites.[87] however, some bees are believed to have a mutualistic relationship with mites.[21] homer's hymn to hermes describes three bee-maidens with the power of divination and thus speaking truth, and identifies the food of the gods as honey. sources associated the bee maidens with apollo and, until the 1980s, scholars followed gottfried hermann (1806) in incorrectly identifying the bee-maidens with the thriae.[88] honey, according to a greek myth, was discovered by a nymph called melissa (""bee""); and honey was offered to the greek gods from mycenean times. bees were also associated with the delphic oracle and the prophetess was sometimes called a bee.[89] the image of a community of honey bees has been used from ancient to modern times, in aristotle and plato; in virgil and seneca; in erasmus and shakespeare; tolstoy, and by political and social theorists such as bernard mandeville and karl marx as a model for human society.[90] in english folklore, bees would be told of important events in the household, in a custom known as ""telling the bees"".[91] some of the oldest examples of bees in art are rock paintings in spain which have been dated to 15,000 bc.[92] w. b. yeats's poem the lake isle of innisfree (1888) contains the couplet ""nine bean rows will i have there, a hive for the honey bee, / and live alone in the bee loud glade."" at the time he was living in bedford park in the west of london.[93] beatrix potter's illustrated book the tale of mrs tittlemouse (1910) features babbity bumble and her brood (pictured). kit williams' treasure hunt book the bee on the comb (1984) uses bees and beekeeping as part of its story and puzzle. sue monk kidd's the secret life of bees (2004), and the 2009 film starring dakota fanning, tells the story of a girl who escapes her abusive home and finds her way to live with a family of beekeepers, the boatwrights. the humorous 2007 animated film bee movie used jerry seinfeld's first script and was his first work for children; he starred as a bee named barry b. benson, alongside renée zellweger. critics found its premise awkward and its delivery tame.[94] dave goulson's a sting in the tale (2014) describes his efforts to save bumblebees in britain, as well as much about their biology. the playwright laline paull's fantasy the bees (2015) tells the tale of a hive bee named flora 717 from hatching onwards.[95] humans have kept honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, for millennia. beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago; efforts to domesticate them are shown in egyptian art around 4,500 years ago.[96] simple hives and smoke were used;[97][98] jars of honey were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as tutankhamun. from the 18th century, european understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony.[99][100] among classical era authors, beekeeping with the use of smoke is described in aristotle's history of animals book 9.[101] the account mentions that bees die after stinging; that workers remove corpses from the hive, and guard it; castes including workers and non-working drones, but ""kings"" rather than queens; predators including toads and bee-eaters; and the waggle dance, with the ""irresistible suggestion"" of άpοσειονται (""aroseiontai"", it waggles) and παρακολουθούσιν (""parakolouthousin"", they watch).[102][b] beekeeping is described in detail by virgil in his georgics; it is also mentioned in his aeneid, and in pliny's natural history.[102] bees play an important role in pollinating flowering plants, and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystems that contain flowering plants. it is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insects, birds and bats, most of which is accomplished by bees, whether wild or domesticated.[103][104] over the last half century, there has been a general decline in the species richness of wild bees and other pollinators, probably attributable to stress from increased parasites and disease, the use of pesticides, and a general decrease in the number of wild flowers. climate change probably exacerbates the problem.[105] contract pollination has overtaken the role of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. after the introduction of varroa mites, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the us, though their numbers have since recovered.[106][107] the number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. in 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder.[108] in 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination.[109][110][111][112] winter losses increased to about 1/3.[113][114] varroa mites were thought to be responsible for about half the losses.[115] apart from colony collapse disorder, losses outside the us have been attributed to causes including pesticide seed dressings, using neonicotinoids such as clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam.[116][117] from 2013 the european union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further.[118] in 2014 the intergovernmental panel on climate change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming.[119] in 2018 the european union decided to ban field use of all three major neonicotinoids; they remain permitted in veterinary, greenhouse, and vehicle transport usage.[120] farmers have focused on alternative solutions to mitigate these problems. by raising native plants, they provide food for native bee pollinators like lasioglossum vierecki[121] and l. leucozonium,[122] leading to less reliance on honey bee populations. honey is a natural product produced by bees and stored for their own use, but its sweetness has always appealed to humans. before domestication of bees was even attempted, humans were raiding their nests for their honey. smoke was often used to subdue the bees and such activities are depicted in rock paintings in spain dated to 15,000 bc.[92] honey bees are used commercially to produce honey.[123] they also produce some substances used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, pollen,[124] propolis,[125] and royal jelly,[126] though all of these can also cause allergic reactions. bees are partly considered edible insects. indigenous people in many countries eat insects, including the larvae and pupae of bees, mostly stingless species. they also gather larvae, pupae and surrounding cells, known as bee brood, for consumption.[127] in the indonesian dish botok tawon from central and east java, bee larvae are eaten as a companion to rice, after being mixed with shredded coconut, wrapped in banana leaves, and steamed.[128][129] bee brood (pupae and larvae) although low in calcium, has been found to be high in protein and carbohydrate, and a useful source of phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and trace minerals iron, zinc, copper, and selenium. in addition, while bee brood was high in fat, it contained no fat soluble vitamins (such as a, d, and e) but it was a good source of most of the water-soluble b-vitamins including choline as well as vitamin c. the fat was composed mostly of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids with 2.0% being polyunsaturated fatty acids.[130][131] apitherapy is a branch of alternative medicine that uses honey bee products, including raw honey, royal jelly, pollen, propolis, beeswax and apitoxin (bee venom).[132] the claim that apitherapy treats cancer, which some proponents of apitherapy make, remains unsupported by evidence-based medicine.[133][134] the painful stings of bees are mostly associated with the poison gland and the dufour's gland which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals. in lasioglossum leucozonium, the dufour's gland mostly contains octadecanolide as well as some eicosanolide. there is also evidence of n-triscosane, n-heptacosane,[135] and 22-docosanolide.[136] however, the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction.[135] "

lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a domesticated carnivore of the family canidae. it is part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] the dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[12][13][14] which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] the dog was the first species to be domesticated,[14][16] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17] their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior,[18] and they can thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[19] dogs vary widely in shape, size, and colors.[20] they perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding disabled people, and therapeutic roles. this influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."" in 1758, the swedish botanist and zoologist carl linnaeus published in his systema naturae the binomial nomenclature – or the two-word naming – of species. canis is the latin word meaning ""dog"",[21] and under this genus, he listed the dog-like carnivores, including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. he classified the domestic dog as canis familiaris, and on the next page, he classified the wolf as canis lupus.[2] linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its cauda recurvata - its upturning tail, which is not found in any other canid.[22] in 1999, a study of mitochondrial dna indicated that the domestic dog might have originated from multiple grey wolf populations, with the dingo and new guinea singing dog ""breeds"" having developed at a time when human communities were more isolated from each other.[23] in the third edition of mammal species of the world published in 2005, the mammalogist w. christopher wozencraft listed under the wolf canis lupus its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: ""familiaris linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]"" and ""dingo meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]"". wozencraft included hallstromi – the new guinea singing dog – as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo. wozencraft referred to the mdna study as one of the guides informing his decision.[4] other mammalogists have noted the inclusion of familiaris and dingo under a ""domestic dog"" clade.[24] this classification by wozencraft is debated among zoologists.[25] in 2019, a workshop hosted by the iucn/species survival commission's canid specialist group considered the new guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs canis familiaris, and therefore should not be assessed for the iucn red list.[26] the domestic dog's origin includes the dog's genetic divergence from the wolf, its domestication, and its development into dog types and dog breeds. the dog is a member of the genus canis, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and was the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated.[14][27] genetic studies comparing dogs with modern wolves show reciprocal monophyly (separate groups), which implies that dogs are not genetically close to any living wolf and that their wild ancestor is extinct.[28][14] an extinct late pleistocene wolf may have been the dog's ancestor,[27][1] with the dog's similarity to the extant grey wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two.[1] in 2020, a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same canis lineage as modern wolves, and proposes that dogs may be descended from a pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dog.[29] the genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago, just before or during the last glacial maximum[30][1] (20,000–27,000 years ago). this period represents the upper time-limit for domestication commencement because it is the time of divergence and not the time of domestication, which occurred later.[30][31] one of the most critical transitions in human history was the domestication of animals, which began with the long-term association between wolves and hunter–gatherers more than 15,000 years ago.[28] the archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the bonn–oberkassel dog buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.[1] by 11,000 years ago, there were five distinct dog lineages all sharing a common ancestry distinct from present-day wolves.[32] domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17] modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.[17] dogs are predators and scavengers; like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, large and sharp claws and teeth, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing. dogs are highly variable in height and weight. the smallest known adult dog was a yorkshire terrier, that stood only 6.3 centimetres (2 1⁄2 inches) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3 3⁄4 in) in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only 113 grams (4 ounces). the most massive known dog was a saint bernard, which weighed 167.6 kg (369 1⁄2 lb) and was 250 cm (8 ft 2 in) from the snout to the tail.[33] the tallest dog is a great dane that stands 106.7 cm (3 ft 6 in) at the shoulder.[34] the dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field. another study suggested that dogs can see the earth's magnetic field.[35][36][37] the coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: ""double"" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or ""single,"" with the topcoat only. breeds may have an occasional ""blaze,"" stripe, or ""star"" of white fur on their chest or underside.[38] the coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrients present in the diet; see coat (dog) for more information. premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is shown to be associated with impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.[39] there are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. as with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be crucial in getting along with others. in some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries.[40] in some breeds, such as the braque du bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.[41] despite their close genetic relationship and interbreedability, there are several diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs. domesticated dogs are distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase.[42] the tympanic bullae are large, convex, and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed, and slightly crumpled.[43] compared with equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains.[44]:35 the teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs.[45] dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive ""stop"" between the forehead and nose.[46] the temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves.[5]:158 wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them.[47] most dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland and enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves, which only do so once a year.[48] so-called primitive dogs such as dingoes and basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycle.[49] dogs generally have brown eyes, and wolves almost always have amber or light-colored eyes.[50] domestic dogs' skin tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather.[51] the paws of a dog are half the size of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves.[52] the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[53] many household plants are poisonous to dogs (and other mammals), including begonia, poinsettia, and aloe vera.[54] some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly. dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms (roundworm species that lives in the heart of dogs). several human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids (theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning),[55] grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol,[56] as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials.[57][58] the nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging through garbage bins or ashtrays and eating cigars and cigarettes. signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. some other symptoms are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.[59] dogs are susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from the ingestion of chocolate. theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that for some dogs, even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, mostly dark chocolate. dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.[60] in 2013, a study found that mixed breed dogs live on average 1.2 years longer than purebred dogs. increasing body-weight was negatively correlated with longevity (i.e., the heavier the dog, the shorter its lifespan).[61] the typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most, the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died, and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years.[62][63][64][65] individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed. the breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with reasonable sample size) is the dogue de bordeaux, with a median longevity of about 5.2 years. still, several breeds, including miniature bull terriers, bloodhounds, and irish wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years.[65] the longest-lived breeds, including toy poodles, japanese spitz, border terriers, and tibetan spaniels, have median longevities of 14 to 15 years.[65] the median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged.[63][64][65][66] the longest-lived dog was ""bluey,"" an australian cattle dog who died in 1939 at 29.5 years of age.[67][68] in domestic dogs, sexual maturity happens around six to twelve months of age for both males and females,[17][69] although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds, and is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. they will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. at the peak of the cycle, females will become estrus, mentally, and physically receptive to copulation.[17] because the ova survive and can be fertilized for a week after ovulation, more than one male can sire the same litter.[17] fertilization typically occurs 2–5 days after ovulation; 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after 7-8 more days, the heartbeat is detectable.[70][71] dogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization,[17][72] with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. an average litter consists of about six puppies,[73] though this number may vary widely based on dog breed. in general, toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve. some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. male french bulldogs, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. for many dogs of this breed, the female must be artificially inseminated to reproduce.[74] neutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removing the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. because of dogs' overpopulation in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals (aspca), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered. that way, they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanized.[75] according to the humane society of the united states, 3–4 million dogs and cats are euthanized each year. many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.[76] local humane societies, spcas, and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them. neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs.[77] spayed female dogs are less likely to develop cancer, affecting mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs.[78] however, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs,[79] and prostate cancer in males,[80] and osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.[81] a common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.g., between half- and full siblings).[82] inbreeding depression is considered to be due mainly to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations.[83] outcrossing between unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.[84] in a study of seven breeds of dogs (bernese mountain dog, basset hound, cairn terrier, epagneul breton, german shepherd dog, leonberger, and west highland white terrier), it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival.[85] another analysis of data on 42,855 dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased, and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.[86] in a study of boxer litters, 22% of puppies died before reaching seven weeks of age.[87] stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding.[87] dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills. a study with rico, a border collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. he inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. a study of another border collie, ""chaser,"" documented his learning and memory capabilities. he had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words.[88] dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing and human voice commands. a 2018 study on canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats.[89] various animals, including pigs, pigeons, and chimpanzees, can remember the ""what, where, and when"" of an event, which dogs cannot do.[90] dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception.[91] an experimental study showed compelling evidence that australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans.[92] another study revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.[93] dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli.[94] as the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years bce, dogs' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. as a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other species, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.[18] behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. these abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.[95] unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.[96][97] in 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs. these gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. these genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response[97][98] (i.e., selection for tameness), and emotional processing.[97] dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves.[97][99] some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and later in breed formation.[97] traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to williams-beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hyper sociability at the expense of problem-solving ability.[100][101][102] dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs, understand messages from humans, and translate the information that dogs are transmitting.[103]:xii communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). humans communicate to dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, and body posture. in 2013, an estimated global dog population was between 700 million[104] and 987 million.[105] although it is said that the ""dog is man's best friend,""[106] this refers mainly to the ~20% of dogs that live in developed countries. in the developing world, dogs are more commonly feral or communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon.[51] most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%).[107] little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries that are feral, stray, or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes.[108] although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral, and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans.[7] for example, a review of the studies in dogs' competitive effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.[109][110] although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.[109][111] wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together.[112] one study reported that in wisconsin, in 1999, more compensation had been paid for losses due to wolves taking dogs than for wolves taking livestock. in wisconsin, wolves will often kill hunting dogs, possibly because they are in the wolf's territory.[112] a strategy has been reported in russia where one wolf lures a dog into a heavy brush where another wolf waits in ambush.[113] in some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed.[114] although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs, and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.[109] coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. in particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them no matter their size.[115] tigers in manchuria, indochina, indonesia, and malaysia are also reported to kill dogs.[116] striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in turkmenistan, india, and the caucasus.[117] dogs have been described as carnivores[118][119] or omnivores.[17][120][121][122] compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.[19] also, like humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva. based on metabolism and nutrition, many consider the dog to be an omnivore.[123] however, the dog is not merely an omnivore. more like the cat and less like other omnivores, the dog can only produce bile acid with taurine, and it cannot produce vitamin d, which it obtains from animal flesh. also, more like the cat, the dog requires arginine to maintain its nitrogen balance. these nutritional requirements place the dog part-way between carnivores and omnivores.[124] as a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog is nearly universal among human societies. notable exceptions once included: dogs were introduced to antarctica as sled dogs but were later outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infections.[132] the domestic dog is the first species, and the only large carnivore, known to have been domesticated. especially over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern dog breeds due to artificial selection by humans. these breeds can vary in size and weight from a 0.46 kg (1 lb) teacup poodle to a 90 kg (200 lb) giant mastiff. phenotypic variation can include height measured to the withers ranging from 15.2 cm (6 in) in the chihuahua to 76 cm (30 in) in the irish wolfhound. color varies from white through grays (usually called ""blue"") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (""red"" or ""chocolate"") in a wide variety of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[133] the skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within carnivores' entire order. some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, demonstrating the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. the first dogs were domesticated from shared ancestors of modern wolves; however, the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog-wolf genetic divergence are unknown.[27] domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language. these sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations. these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species today.[134]:pages95–136 the dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding disabled individuals. this influence on human society has given them the nickname ""man's best friend"" in the western world. in some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.[135][136] wolves, and their dog descendants, likely derived significant benefits from living in human camps – more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.[137] they would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them a more extensive range over which to see potential predators and prey, and better color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.[137] camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use, bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for various purposes.[137] humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.[138] for instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.[138] dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the australian aboriginal expression ""three dog night"" (a frigidly cold night). they would have alerted the camp to predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.[138] it has been suggested that the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt.[138] the relationship between a dog's presence and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting were an essential factor in wolf domestication.[139] the cohabitation of dogs and humans likely improved the chances of survival for early human groups. the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.[140] human emigrants from siberia that came across the bering land bridge into north america likely had dogs in their company. although one writer[141] even suggests that sled dogs' use may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered north america roughly 12,000 years ago,[141] the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in north america dates from about 9,400 years ago.[134]:104[142] dogs were an important part of life for the athabascan population in north america and were their only domesticated animal. dogs as pack animals may have contributed to the apache and navajo tribes' migration 1,400 years ago. this use of dogs in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the horse to north america.[143] it is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.[51] ""the most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs""[138] and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history[144] (see the bonn–oberkassel dog). pet-dog populations grew significantly after world war ii as suburbanization increased.[144] in the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today[145] (the expression ""in the doghouse"" - recorded since 1932[146] - to describe exclusion from the group implies a distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. from the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog's role, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.[147] people and their dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives,[148] to the point where pet dogs actively shape how a family and home are experienced.[149] there have been two significant trends occurring within the second half of the 20th century in pet dogs' changing status. the first has been the ""commodification,"" shaping it to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior.[149] the second has been the broadening of the family's concept and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.[149] a vast range of commodity forms aims to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.[150] the list of goods, services, and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture, and housing, to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines, and cemeteries.[150] while dog training as an organized activity has operated since the 18th century, it became a high-profile issue in the last decades of the 20th century. many normal dog behaviors such as barking, jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine marking (which dogs do to establish territory through scent) became increasingly incompatible with a pet dog's new role.[151] dog training books, classes, and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.[152] the majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of the family,[149] although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as a pack.[149] some dog-trainers, such as on the television program dog whisperer, have promoted a dominance-model of dog-human relationships. however, it has been disputed that ""trying to achieve status"" is characteristic of dog-human interactions.[153] pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog; to mediate their interactions with each other.[154] increasingly, human family-members engage in activities centered on the dog's perceived needs and interests, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.[150] according to statistics published by the american pet products manufacturers association in the national pet owner survey in 2009–2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the united states have pet dogs.[155] the same source shows that nearly 40% of american households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. there does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets. although several programs promote pet adoption, less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from shelters. some research suggests that a pet dog produces a considerable carbon footprint.[156][157] a study using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to compare humans and dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do. this gives dogs the ability to recognize human emotional sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans.[158] dogs have lived and worked with humans in many roles. in addition to dogs' role as companion animals, dogs have been bred for herding livestock (collies, sheepdogs),[159][17] hunting (hounds, pointers),[44] and rodent control (terriers).[17] other types of working dogs include search and rescue dogs,[160] detection dogs trained to detect illicit drugs[161] or chemical weapons;[162] guard dogs; dogs who assist fishermen with the use of nets; and dogs that pull loads.[17] in 1957, the dog laika became the first animal to be launched into earth orbit, aboard the soviets' sputnik 2; she died during the flight.[163][164] various kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs, including guide dogs, hearing dogs, mobility assistance dogs, and psychiatric service dogs, assist individuals with disabilities.[165][166] some dogs owned by people with epilepsy have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care.[167] people often enter their dogs in competitions,[168] such as breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, sledding, and agility competitions. in conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. as the breed standard only deals with the dog's externally observable qualities (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows. dog meat is consumed in some east asian countries, including korea,[169] china,[135] vietnam,[136] and the philippines,[170] which dates back to antiquity.[171] it is estimated that 13–16 million dogs are killed and consumed in asia every year.[172] in china, debates have ensued over banning the consumption of dog meat.[173] following the sui and tang dynasties of the first millennium, however, people living on northern china's plains began to eschew eating dogs, which is likely due to buddhism and islam's spread, two religions that forbade the consumption of certain animals, including dog. as members of the upper classes shunned dog meat, it gradually became a social taboo to eat it, even though the general population continued to consume it for centuries afterward.[174] dog meat is also consumed in some parts of switzerland.[175] other cultures, such as polynesia and pre-columbian mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. dog fat is also reportedly believed to be beneficial for the lungs in some parts of poland[176][177] and central asia.[178][179] proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is western hypocrisy and that there is no difference in eating different animals' meat.[180][181][182][183] in korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the nureongi (누렁이), differs from those breeds raised for pets that koreans may keep in their homes.[184] the most popular korean dog dish is gaejang-guk (also called bosintang), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months. followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's gi or the body's vital energy. a 19th-century version of gaejang-guk explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder. variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. while the dishes are still prevalent in korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.[184] in 2005, the who reported that 55,000 people died in asia and africa from rabies, a disease for which dogs are the most important vector.[185] citing a 2008 study, the u.s. centers for disease control estimated in 2015 that 4.5 million people in the usa are bitten by dogs each year.[186] a 2015 study estimated that 1.8% of the u.s. population is bitten each year.[187] in the 1980s and 1990s, the u.s. averaged 17 fatalities per year, while since 2007, this has increased to an average of 31.[188] 77% of dog bites are from the pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the dog's legal owner's property.[188] a colorado study found bites in children were less severe than bites in adults.[189] the incidence of dog bites in the u.s. is 12.9 per 10,000 inhabitants, but for boys aged 5 to 9, the incidence rate is 60.7 per 10,000. moreover, children have a much higher chance of being bitten in the face or neck.[190] sharp claws with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infections.[191] in the u.k., between 2003 and 2004, there were 5,868 dog attacks on humans, resulting in 5,770 working days lost in sick leave.[192] in the united states, cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year.[193] it has been estimated that around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in u.k. hospitals are domestic accidents. the same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to quantify, dog-associated road accidents involving injury more commonly involved two-wheeled vehicles.[194] toxocara canis (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis. in the united states, about 10,000 cases of toxocara infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the u.s. population is infected.[195] in great britain, 24% of soil samples taken from public parks contained t. canis eggs.[196][failed verification] untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision.[196] dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans.[197][198][199][200] dogs suffer from the same common disorders as humans; these include cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and neurologic disorders. the pathology is similar to humans, as is their response to treatment and their outcomes. researchers are now identifying the genes associated with dog diseases similar to human disorders but lack mouse models to find cures for dogs and humans. the genes involved in canine obsessive-compulsive disorders led to the detection of four genes in humans' related pathways.[201] the scientific evidence is mixed as to whether a dog's companionship can enhance human physical health and psychological well-being.[202] studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological well-being [203] have been criticized for being poorly controlled.[204] it found that ""the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal."" earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.[205] a 2005 paper states, ""recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets.""[202] in one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition. this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.[206] people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. the results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behavior and that for guardians of dogs, these effects are relatively long-term.[206] pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival. human guardians are significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.[207] the health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, not solely from having dogs as pets. for example, when in a pet dog's presence, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety.[208] other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases according to the hygiene hypothesis. the benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs cannot only provide companionship and social support themselves but also act as facilitators of social interactions between humans.[209] one study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when accompanied by a dog than when they are not.[210] in 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners.[211] using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders.[212] animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people with alzheimer's disease.[213] one study demonstrated that children with adhd and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives, and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those not in an animal-assisted program.[214] every year, between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats enter u.s. animal shelters.[215] the humane society of the united states (hsus) estimates that approximately 3 to 4 million of those dogs and cats are euthanized yearly in the united states.[216] the percentage of dogs in u.s. animal shelters eventually adopted and removed from shelters by their new legal owners has increased since the mid-1990s from around 25% to a 2012 average of 40% among reporting shelters[217] (with many shelters reporting 60–75%).[218] in china, korea, and japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.[220] in ancient mesopotamia, from the old babylonian period until the neo-babylonian, dogs were the symbol of ninisina, the goddess of healing and medicine,[221] and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her.[221] in the neo-assyrian and neo-babylonian periods, dogs were used as emblems of magical protection.[221] in mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs.[220] stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout indo-european mythologies[222][223] and may originate from proto-indo-european religion.[222][223] in greek mythology, cerberus is a three-headed watchdog who guards the gates of hades.[220] in norse mythology, a bloody, four-eyed dog called garmr guards helheim.[220] in persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the chinvat bridge.[220] in welsh mythology, annwn is guarded by cŵn annwn.[220] in hindu mythology, yama, the god of death, owns two watchdogs who have four eyes. they are said to watch over the gates of naraka.[224] the hunter god muthappan from the north malabar region of kerala has a hunting dog as his mount. dogs are found in and out of the muthappan temple, and offerings at the shrine take the form of bronze dog figurines.[225] in philippine mythology, kimat, the pet of tadaklan, the god of thunder, is responsible for lightning. the dog's role in chinese mythology includes a position as one of the twelve animals that cyclically represent years (the zodiacal dog). three of the 88 constellations in western astronomy also represent dogs: in christianity, dogs represent faithfulness.[220] within the roman catholic denomination specifically, the iconography of saint dominic includes a dog, after the hallow's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly after that.[226] as such, the dominican order (ecclesiastical latin: dominicanus) means ""dogs of the lord"" or ""hounds of the lord"" (ecclesiastical latin: domini canis).[226] in christian folklore, a church grim often takes the form of a black dog to guard christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilege.[227] jewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets.[228] jewish law requires jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them.[228] the view on dogs in islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing it as unclean,[220] although khaled abou el fadl states that this view is based on ""pre-islamic arab mythology"" and ""a tradition to be falsely attributed to the prophet.""[229] therefore, sunni malaki and hanafi jurists permit the trade of and keeping of dogs as pets.[230] in homer's epic poem the odyssey, when the disguised odysseus returns home after 20 years, he is recognized only by his faithful dog, argos, who has been waiting for his return. cultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on caves' walls. representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved, and the relationships between human and canine developed. hunting scenes were popular in the middle ages and the renaissance. dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.[231] the american kennel club reopened a museum called ""museum of the dog"" in manhattan after moving the attraction from outside of st. louis.[232] the museum contains ancient artifacts, fine art, and educational opportunities for visitors.[232].mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinner{display:flex;flex-direction:column}.mw-parser-output .tmulti

bear," amphicynodontinae hemicyoninae ursavinae agriotheriinae ailuropodinae tremarctinae ursinae bears are carnivoran mammals of the family ursidae. they are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the northern hemisphere and partially in the southern hemisphere. bears are found on the continents of north america, south america, europe, and asia. common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. while the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. with the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. they may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days. bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. with their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. in modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the asian bile bear market. the iucn lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. the poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing. the english word ""bear"" comes from old english bera and belongs to a family of names for the bear in germanic languages, such as swedish björn, also used as a first name. this form is conventionally said to be related to a proto-indo-european word for ""brown"", so that ""bear"" would mean ""the brown one"".[1][2] however, ringe notes that while this etymology is semantically plausible, a word meaning ""brown"" of this form cannot be found in proto-indo-european. he suggests instead that ""bear"" is from the proto-indo-european word *ǵʰwḗr- ~ *ǵʰwér ""wild animal"".[3] this terminology for the animal originated as a taboo avoidance term: proto-germanic tribes replaced their original word for bear—arkto—with this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animal's true name might cause it to appear.[4][5] according to author ralph keyes, this is the oldest known euphemism.[6] bear taxon names such as arctoidea and helarctos come from the ancient greek ἄρκτος (arktos), meaning bear,[7] as do the names ""arctic"" and ""antarctic"", via the name of the constellation ursa major, the ""great bear"", prominent in the northern sky.[8] bear taxon names such as ursidae and ursus come from latin ursus/ursa, he-bear/she-bear.[8] the female first name ""ursula"", originally derived from a christian saint's name, means ""little she-bear"" (diminutive of latin ursa). in switzerland, the male first name ""urs"" is especially popular, while the name of the canton and city of bern is derived from bär, german for bear. the germanic name bernard (including bernhardt and similar forms) means ""bear-brave"", ""bear-hardy"", or ""bold bear"".[9][10] the old english name beowulf is a kenning, ""bee-wolf"", for bear, in turn meaning a brave warrior.[11] the family ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder caniformia, or ""doglike"" carnivorans, within the order carnivora. bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids.[12] modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), tremarctinae (monotypic with the spectacled bear), and ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74 chromosomes (see ursid hybrid), whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. these smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in ursidae rather than in procyonidae, where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.[13] the earliest members of ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily amphicynodontinae, including parictis (late eocene to early middle miocene, 38–18 mya) and the slightly younger allocyon (early oligocene, 34–30 mya), both from north america. these animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, with diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. parictis does not appear in eurasia and africa until the miocene.[14] it is unclear whether late-eocene ursids were also present in eurasia, although faunal exchange across the bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late eocene (about 37 mya) and continuing into the early oligocene.[15] european genera morphologically very similar to allocyon, and to the much younger american kolponomos (about 18 mya),[16] are known from the oligocene, including amphicticeps and amphicynodon.[15] there has been various morphological evidence linking amphicynodontines with pinnipeds, as both groups were semi-aquatic, otter-like mammals.[17][18][19] in addition to the support of the pinniped–amphicynodontine clade, other morphological and some molecular evidence supports bears being the closet living relatives to pinnipeds.[20][21][22][18][23][19] the raccoon-sized, dog-like cephalogale is the oldest-known member of the subfamily hemicyoninae, which first appeared during the middle oligocene in eurasia about 30 mya.[15] the subfamily includes the younger genera phoberocyon (20–15 mya), and plithocyon (15–7 mya). a cephalogale-like species gave rise to the genus ursavus during the early oligocene (30–28 mya); this genus proliferated into many species in asia and is ancestral to all living bears. species of ursavus subsequently entered north america, together with amphicynodon and cephalogale, during the early miocene (21–18 mya). members of the living lineages of bears diverged from ursavus between 15 and 20 mya,[24][25] likely via the species ursavus elmensis. based on genetic and morphological data, the ailuropodinae (pandas) were the first to diverge from other living bears about 19 mya, although no fossils of this group have been found before about 5 mya.[26] the new world short-faced bears (tremarctinae) differentiated from ursinae following a dispersal event into north america during the mid-miocene (about 13 mya).[26] they invaded south america (≈2.5 or 1.2 ma) following formation of the isthmus of panama.[27] their earliest fossil representative is plionarctos in north america (c. 10–2 ma). this genus is probably the direct ancestor to the north american short-faced bears (genus arctodus), the south american short-faced bears (arctotherium), and the spectacled bears, tremarctos, represented by both an extinct north american species (t. floridanus), and the lone surviving representative of the tremarctinae, the south american spectacled bear (t. ornatus).[15] the subfamily ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5 mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first members of the genus ursus appeared around this time.[26] the sloth bear is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early pleistocene. by 3–4 mya, the species ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's asian black bear. it is likely ancestral to all bears within ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. two lineages evolved from u. minimus: the black bears (including the sun bear, the asian black bear, and the american black bear); and the brown bears (which includes the polar bear). modern brown bears evolved from u. minimus via ursus etruscus, which itself is ancestral to the extinct pleistocene cave bear. species of ursinae have migrated repeatedly into north america from eurasia as early as 4 mya during the early pliocene.[28][29] the polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from a population of brown bears that became isolated in northern latitudes by glaciation 400,000 years ago.[30] the bears form a clade within the carnivora. the cladogram is based on molecular phylogeny of six genes in flynn, 2005.[31] .mw-parser-output table.clade{border-spacing:0;margin:0;font-size:100%;line-height:100%;border-collapse:separate;width:auto}.mw-parser-output

†hemicyonidae ursidae pinnipedia ailuridae procyonidae mustelidae note that although they are called ""bears"" in some languages, red pandas and raccoons and their close relatives are not bears, but rather musteloids.[31] there are two phylogenetic hypotheses on the relationships among extant and fossil bear species. one is all species of bears are classified in seven subfamilies as adopted here and related articles: amphicynodontinae, hemicyoninae, ursavinae, agriotheriinae, ailuropodinae, tremarctinae, and ursinae.[32][33][34][35] below is a cladogram of the subfamilies of bears after mclellan and reiner (1992)[32] and qiu et al. (2014):[35] amphicynodontinae hemicyoninae ursavinae agriotheriinae ailuropodinae tremarctinae ursinae the second alternative phylogenetic hypothesis was implemented by mckenna et al. (1997) is to classify all the bear species into the superfamily ursoidea, with hemicyoninae and agriotheriinae being classified in the family ""hemicyonidae"".[36] amphicynodontinae under this classification were classified as stem-pinnipeds in the superfamily phocoidea.[36] in the mckenna and bell classification both bears and pinnipeds in a parvorder of carnivoran mammals known as ursida, along with the extinct bear dogs of the family amphicyonidae.[36] below is the cladogram based on mckenna and bell (1997) classification:[36] amphicyonidae amphicynodontidae pinnipedia hemicyoninae agriotheriinae ursavinae ailuropodinae tremarctinae ursinae the phylogeny of extant bear species is shown in a cladogram based on complete mitochondrial dna sequences from yu et al. (2007)[37] the giant panda, followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest species. the relationships of the other species are not very well resolved, though the polar bear and the brown bear form a close grouping.[13] brown bear polar bear asian black bear american black bear sun bear sloth bear spectacled bear giant panda the bear family includes the most massive extant terrestrial members of the order carnivora.[a] the polar bear is considered to be the largest extant species,[39] with adult males weighing 350–700 kilograms (770–1,500 pounds) and measuring 2.4–3 metres (7 ft 10 in–9 ft 10 in) in total length.[40] the smallest species is the sun bear, which ranges 25–65 kg (55–145 lb) in weight and 100–140 cm (40–55 in) in length.[41] prehistoric north and south american short-faced bears were the largest species known to have lived. the latter estimated to have weighed 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) and stood 3.4 m (11 ft 2 in) tall.[42][43] body weight varies throughout the year in bears of temperate and arctic climates, as they build up fat reserves in the summer and autumn and lose weight during the winter.[44] bears are generally bulky and robust animals with short tails. they are sexually dimorphic with regard to size, with males typically being larger.[45][46] larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species.[46] relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. the shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. the limbs are much straighter than those of the big cats as there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. the strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.[44] unlike most other land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. they distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering when they walk. they are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. the claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.[44] most mammals have agouti hair, with each individual hair shaft having bands of color corresponding to two different types of melanin pigment. bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single color throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. the coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. the shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-colored skin below. they have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur.[44] while bears tend to be uniform in color, some species may have markings on the chest or face and the giant panda has a bold black-and-white pelage.[47] bears have small rounded ears so as to minimize heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. unlike many other carnivorans they have color vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. they are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better than that of the dog, or possibly any other mammal. they use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.[44] the skulls of bears are massive, providing anchorage for the powerful masseter and temporal jaw muscles. the canine teeth are large but mostly used for display, and the molar teeth flat and crushing. unlike most other members of the carnivora, bears have relatively undeveloped carnassial teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter.[44] considerable variation occurs in dental formula even within a given species. this may indicate bears are still in the process of evolving from a mainly meat-eating diet to a predominantly herbivorous one. polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved carnassial-like cheek teeth, as their diets have switched back towards carnivory.[48] sloth bears lack lower central incisors and use their protusible lips for sucking up the termites on which they feed.[44] the general dental formula for living bears is: 3.1.2–4.23.1.2–4.3.[44] the structure of the larynx of bears appears to be the most basal of the caniforms.[49] they possess air pouches connected to the pharynx which may amplify their vocalizations.[50] bears have a fairly simple digestive system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum.[51][52] even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.[53] bears must spend much of their time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. the panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.[54] extant bears are found in sixty countries primarily in the northern hemisphere and are concentrated in asia, north america, and europe. an exception is the spectacled bear; native to south america, it inhabits the andean region.[55] the sun bear's range extends below the equator in southeast asia.[56] the atlas bear, a subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in north africa from morocco to libya, but it became extinct around the 1870s.[57] the most widespread species is the brown bear, which occurs from western europe eastwards through asia to the western areas of north america. the american black bear is restricted to north america, and the polar bear is restricted to the arctic sea. all the remaining species of bear are asian.[55] they occur in a range of habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, arctic tundra and in the case of the polar bear, ice floes.[55][58] bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.[58] brown and american black bears are generally diurnal, meaning that they are active for the most part during the day, though they may forage substantially by night.[59] other species may be nocturnal, active at night, though female sloth bears with cubs may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecifics and nocturnal predators.[60] bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the carnivora. the only times bears are encountered in groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs).[61][62] fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive scarring, which suggests that maintaining dominance can be intense.[63] with their acute sense of smell, bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away. they use olfaction to locate other foods, encounter mates, avoid rivals and recognize their cubs.[44] most bears are opportunistic omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter. they eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted to such a diet.[55] at the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. however, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available.[54] for example, asiatic black bears in taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.[64] when foraging for plants, bears choose to eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves.[52][54] hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted.[65] knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behavior.[54] berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage.[65] in autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behavior.[66] smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns).[67] such masts can be very important to the diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources.[68] brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots.[65] the panda's diet is over 99% bamboo,[69] of 30 different species. its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves.[70][71] bromeliads can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.[72] the sloth bear, though not as specialized as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other burrowing insects they favour. at certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets.[73] some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults.[74] sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey.[75] fish are an important source of food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs. typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. the preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. small burrowing mammals like rodents may be dug out and eaten.[76][65] the brown bear and both species of black bears sometimes take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly the young and weak.[64][77][76] these animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on.[65][78] the polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. they primarily eat the highly digestible blubber.[79][76] large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled.[65][80] predatory behavior in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.[76] bears are prolific scavengers and kleptoparasites, stealing food caches from rodents, and carcasses from other predators.[52][81] for hibernating species, weight gain is important as it provides nourishment during winter dormancy. a brown bear can eat 41 kg (90 lb) of food and gain 2–3 kg (4–7 lb) of fat a day prior to entering its den.[82] bears produce a number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. tongue-clicking, grunting or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, snorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.[49][83][84][85][86][87] bears sometimes communicate with visual displays such as standing upright, which exaggerates the individual's size. the chest markings of some species may add to this intimidating display. staring is an aggressive act and the facial markings of spectacled bears and giant pandas may help draw attention to the eyes during agonistic encounters.[47] individuals may approach each other by stiff-legged walking with the head lowered. dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing the canine teeth, muzzle twisting and neck stretching. a subordinate may respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying down.[62][88] bears may mark territory by rubbing against trees and other objects which may serve to spread their scent. this is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. bark may be spread around to draw attention to the marking post.[89] pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands.[90] polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast arctic wilderness.[91] the mating system of bears has variously been described as a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy.[92][93][94] during the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. a male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. during this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. courtship may be brief, although in some asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalizing. ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.[93] gestation typically lasts 6–9 months, including delayed implantation, and litter size numbers up to four cubs.[95] giant pandas may give birth to twins but they can only suckle one young and the other is left to die.[96] in northern living species, birth takes place during winter dormancy. cubs are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair, relying on their mother for warmth. the milk of the female bear is rich in fat and antibodies and cubs may suckle for up to a year after they are born. by 2–3 months, cubs can follow their mother outside the den. they usually follow her on foot, but sloth bear cubs may ride on their mother's back.[95][58] male bears play no role in raising young. infanticide, where an adult male kills the cubs of another, has been recorded in polar bears, brown bears and american black bears but not in other species.[97] males kill young to bring the female into estrus.[98] cubs may flee and the mother defends them even at the cost of her life.[99][100][101] in some species, offspring may become independent around the next spring, through some may stay until the female successfully mates again. bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse; at around 3–6 years depending on the species. male alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old.[95] lifespan may also vary between species. the brown bear can live an average of 25 years.[102] bears of northern regions, including the american black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter.[103][104] during hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute.[105] bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating.[44] a fecal plug is formed in the colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring.[106] if they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea.[44] female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.[104] bears do not have many predators. the most important are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease.[107] felids like the tiger may also prey on bears,[108][109] particularly cubs, which may also be threatened by canids.[13][94] bears are parasitized by eighty species of parasites, including single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. a study of american black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan sarcocystis, the parasitic worm diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes dirofilaria immitis, capillaria aerophila, physaloptera sp., strongyloides sp. and others. of these, d. mansonoides and adult c. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms.[110] by contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style is such that few alternative hosts exist in their environment. the protozoan toxoplasma gondii has been found in polar bears, and the nematode trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears.[111] bears in north america are sometimes infected by a morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus.[112] they are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (cav-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.[113] in modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats[114] and illegal trade in bear parts, including the asian bile bear market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming.[115] the iucn lists six bear species as vulnerable;[116] even the two least concern species, the brown bear and the american black bear,[116] are at risk of extirpation in certain areas. in general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.[117] laws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. public perception of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance.[118] support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies.[119] the giant panda has become a worldwide symbol of conservation. the sichuan giant panda sanctuaries, which are home to around 30% of the wild panda population, gained a unesco world heritage site designation in 2006.[120] where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans.[121][122] in poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears, and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.[121] several bear species are dangerous to humans, especially in areas where they have become used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans. injuries caused by bears are rare, but are widely reported.[123] bears may attack humans in response to being startled, in defense of young or food, or even for predatory reasons.[124] bears in captivity have for centuries been used for entertainment. they have been trained to dance,[125] and were kept for baiting in europe at least since the 16th century. there were five bear-baiting gardens in southwark, london at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived.[126] across europe, nomadic romani bear handlers called ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.[127] bears have been hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. their meat is dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. in cantonese cuisine, bear paws are considered a delicacy. bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, as it can be infected with the parasite trichinella spiralis.[128][129] the peoples of eastern asia use bears' body parts and secretions (notably their gallbladders and bile) as part of traditional chinese medicine. more than 12,000 bears are thought to be kept on farms in china, vietnam, and south korea for the production of bile. trade in bear products is prohibited under cites, but bear bile has been detected in shampoos, wine and herbal medicines sold in canada, the united states and australia.[130] bears have been popular subjects in art, literature, folklore and mythology. the image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in north america and eurasia, based on the female's devotion and protection of her cubs.[131] in many native american cultures, the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence.[132] a widespread belief among cultures of north america and northern asia associated bears with shaman; this may be based on the solitary nature of both. bears have thus been thought to predict the future and shaman were believed to have been capable of transforming into bears.[133] there is evidence of prehistoric bear worship, though this is disputed by archaeologists.[134] it is possible that bear worship existed in early chinese and ainu cultures.[135] the prehistoric finns,[136] siberian peoples[137] and more recently koreans considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers.[138] artio (dea artio in the gallo-roman religion) was a celtic bear goddess. evidence of her worship has notably been found at bern, itself named for the bear. her name is derived from the celtic word for ""bear"", artos.[139] in ancient greece, the archaic cult of artemis in bear form survived into classical times at brauron, where young athenian girls passed an initiation right as arktai ""she bears"".[140] the constellations of ursa major and ursa minor, the great and little bears, are named for their supposed resemblance to bears, from the time of ptolemy.[b][8] the nearby star arcturus means ""guardian of the bear"", as if it were watching the two constellations.[142] ursa major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since paleolithic times, in the widespread cosmic hunt myths. these are found on both sides of the bering land bridge, which was lost to the sea some 11,000 years ago.[143] bears are popular in children's stories, including winnie the pooh,[144] paddington bear,[145] gentle ben[146] and ""the brown bear of norway"".[147] an early version of ""goldilocks and the three bears"",[148] was published as ""the three bears"" in 1837 by robert southey, many times retold, and illustrated in 1918 by arthur rackham.[149] the hanna-barbera character yogi bear has appeared in numerous comic books, animated television shows and films.[150][151] the care bears began as greeting cards in 1982, and were featured as toys, on clothing and in film.[152] around the world, many children—and some adults—have teddy bears, stuffed toys in the form of bears, named after the american statesman theodore roosevelt when in 1902 he had refused to shoot an american black bear tied to a tree.[153] bears, like other animals, may symbolize nations. the russian bear has been a common national personification for russia from the 16th century onward.[154] smokey bear has become a part of american culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message ""only you can prevent forest fires"".[155] the international association for bear research & management, also known as the international bear association, and the bear specialist group of the species survival commission, a part of the international union for conservation of nature focus on the natural history, management, and conservation of bears. bear trust international works for wild bears and other wildlife through four core program initiatives, namely conservation education, wild bear research, wild bear management, and habitat conservation.[156] specialty organizations for each of the eight species of bears worldwide include: "
bird," birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class aves /ˈeɪviːz/, characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) ostrich. there are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or ""perching"" birds. birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. the digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. birds are a group of feathered theropod dinosaurs, and constitute the only living dinosaurs. likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose members include archaeopteryx) which first appeared about 160 million years ago (mya) in china. according to dna evidence, modern birds (neornithes) evolved in the middle to late cretaceous, and diversified dramatically around the time of the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event 66 mya, which killed off the pterosaurs and all non-avian dinosaurs. many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. the vast majority of bird species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. they are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. guano (bird excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. birds figure throughout human culture. about 120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry. the first classification of birds was developed by francis willughby and john ray in their 1676 volume ornithologiae.[3] carl linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use.[4] birds are categorised as the biological class aves in linnaean taxonomy. phylogenetic taxonomy places aves in the dinosaur clade theropoda.[5] aves and a sister group, the order crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade archosauria. during the late 1990s, aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and archaeopteryx lithographica.[6] however, an earlier definition proposed by jacques gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many scientists including adherents of the phylocode system. gauthier defined aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds. this was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the broader group avialae,[7] in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs. gauthier and de queiroz[8] identified four different definitions for the same biological name ""aves"", which is a problem. the authors proposed to reserve the term aves only for the crown group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants, which corresponds to meaning number 4 below. he assigned other names to the other groups. crocodiles birds turtles lizards (including snakes) under the fourth definition archaeopteryx, traditionally considered one of the earliest members of aves, is removed from this group, becoming a non-avian dinosaur instead. these proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of palaeontology and bird evolution, though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent. avialae, initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of aves, is often used synonymously with the vernacular term ""bird"" by these researchers.[9] †coelurus †ornitholestes †ornithomimosauria †alvarezsauridae †oviraptorosauria paraves most researchers define avialae as branch-based clade, though definitions vary. many authors have used a definition similar to ""all theropods closer to birds than to deinonychus"",[11][12] with troodon being sometimes added as a second external specifier in case it is closer to birds than to deinonychus.[13] avialae is also occasionally defined as an apomorphy-based clade (that is, one based on physical characteristics). jacques gauthier, who named avialae in 1986, re-defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight, and the birds that descended from them.[8][14] despite being currently one of the most widely used, the crown-group definition of aves has been criticised by some researchers. lee and spencer (1997) argued that, contrary to what gauthier defended, this definition would not increase the stability of the clade and the exact content of aves will always be uncertain because any defined clade (either crown or not) will have few synapomorphies distinguishing it from its closest relatives. their alternative definition is synonymous to avifilopluma.[15] †scansoriopterygidae †eosinopteryx †jinfengopteryx †aurornis †dromaeosauridae †troodontidae avialae based on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs,[18] and more specifically, they are members of maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurids and oviraptorosaurs, among others.[19] as scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred. recent discoveries in the liaoning province of northeast china, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.[20][21][22] the consensus view in contemporary palaeontology is that the flying theropods, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids.[23] together, these form a group called paraves. some basal members of deinonychosauria, such as microraptor, have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. the most basal deinonychosaurs were very small. this evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal, have been able to glide, or both.[24][25] unlike archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores.[26] the late jurassic archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found, and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century. archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics—teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail—as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds. it is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor.[27] over 40% of key traits found in modern birds evolved during the 60 million year transition from the earliest bird-line archosaurs to the first maniraptoromorphs, i.e. the first dinosaurs closer to living birds than to tyrannosaurus rex. the loss of osteoderms otherwise common in archosaurs and acquisition of primitive feathers might have occurred early during this phase.[10][29] after the appearance of maniraptoromorpha, the next 40 million years marked a continuous reduction of body size and the accumulation of neotenic (juvenile-like) characteristics. hypercarnivory became increasingly less common while braincases enlarged and forelimbs became longer.[10] the integument evolved into complex, pennaceous feathers.[29] the oldest known paravian (and probably the earliest avialan) fossils come from the tiaojishan formation of china, which has been dated to the late jurassic period (oxfordian stage), about 160 million years ago. the avialan species from this time period include anchiornis huxleyi, xiaotingia zhengi, and aurornis xui.[9] the well-known probable early avialan, archaeopteryx, dates from slightly later jurassic rocks (about 155 million years old) from germany. many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds, but were later lost during bird evolution. these features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life, and long feathers or ""hind wings"" covering the hind limbs and feet, which may have been used in aerial maneuvering.[30] avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the cretaceous period. many groups retained primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (aves).[31] increasingly stiff tails (especially the outermost half) can be seen in the evolution of maniraptoromorphs, and this process culminated in the appearance of the pygostyle, an ossification of fused tail vertebrae.[10] in the late cretaceous, about 100 million years ago, the ancestors of all modern birds evolved a more open pelvis, allowing them to lay larger eggs compared to body size.[32] around 95 million years ago, they evolved a better sense of smell.[33] a third stage of bird evolution starting with ornithothoraces (the ""bird-chested"" avialans) can be associated with the refining of aerodynamics and flight capabilities, and the loss or co-ossification of several skeletal features. particularly significant are the development of an enlarged, keeled sternum and the alula, and the loss of grasping hands.

classification of birds is a contentious issue. sibley and ahlquist's phylogeny and classification of birds (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds,[51] although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate,[52] but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and dna have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. more recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.[53][45] as of 2020[update], the genome has been sequenced for at least one species in about 90% of extant avian families (218 out of 236 families recognised by the howard and moore checklist).[54] see list of sequenced animal genomes. birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents, reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel's breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres (270 mi) inland in antarctica.[56] the highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions. it was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics; however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics.[57] many species migrate annually over great distances and across oceans; several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them, and some seabird species come ashore only to breed,[58] while some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (980 ft) deep.[59] many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans. some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird.[60] others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several north american cities after their escape from captivity.[61] some species, including cattle egret,[62] yellow-headed caracara[63] and galah,[64] have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat. compared with other vertebrates, birds have a body plan that shows many unusual adaptations, mostly to facilitate flight. the skeleton consists of very lightweight bones. they have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the respiratory system.[65] the skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures.[66] the orbits are large and separated by a bony septum. the spine has cervical, thoracic, lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical (neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae.[67] the last few are fused with the pelvis to form the synsacrum.[66] the ribs are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders. the forelimbs are modified into wings.[68] the wings are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups that lost their wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds.[69] like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid, instead of urea or ammonia, through the ureters into the intestine. birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with faeces as a semisolid waste.[70][71][72] however, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia.[73] they also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals.[66] this material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca.[74][75] the cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. in addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets.[76] it is a common but not universal feature of altricial passerine nestlings (born helpless, under constant parental care) that instead of excreting directly into the nest, they produce a fecal sac. this is a mucus-covered pouch that allows parents to either dispose of the waste outside the nest or to recycle the waste through their own digestive system.[77] males within palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in galliformes (but fully developed in cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in neoaves.[78][79] the length is thought to be related to sperm competition.[80] when not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. female birds have sperm storage tubules[81] that allow sperm to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species.[82] sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. most female birds have a single ovary and a single oviduct, both on the left side,[83] but there are exceptions: species in at least 16 different orders of birds have two ovaries. even these species, however, tend to have a single oviduct.[83] it has been speculated that this might be an adaptation to flight, but males have two testes, and it is also observed that the gonads in both sexes decrease dramatically in size outside the breeding season.[84][85] also terrestrial birds generally have a single ovary, as does the platypus, an egg-laying mammal. a more likely explanation is that the egg develops a shell while passing through the oviduct over a period of about a day, so that if two eggs were to develop at the same time, there would be a risk to survival.[83] birds have two sexes: either female or male. the sex of birds is determined by the z and w sex chromosomes, rather than by the x and y chromosomes present in mammals. male birds have two z chromosomes (zz), and female birds have a w chromosome and a z chromosome (wz).[66] in nearly all species of birds, an individual's sex is determined at fertilisation. however, one recent study claimed to demonstrate temperature-dependent sex determination among the australian brushturkey, for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male sex ratio.[86] this, however, was later proven to not be the case. these birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, but temperature-dependent sex mortality.[87] birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups.[66] upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. the other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. when the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation.[88] sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea;[89] the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.[90] in birds, the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right aortic arch (or pharyngeal arch), unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms this part of the aorta.[66] the postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system. unlike in mammals, the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus.[91] the avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. this pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication.[92] the heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. the atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. the sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarising signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. the avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers.[92] the atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. this adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.[93] birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. as a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal.[93] the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular contractions, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body.[94] as the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. in the capillary beds, blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. once the blood has become deoxygenated, it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. as blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart.[94] once the blood reaches the heart, it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body. the nervous system is large relative to the bird's size.[66] the most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. most birds have a poor sense of smell[95] with notable exceptions including kiwis,[96] new world vultures[97] and tubenoses.[98] the avian visual system is usually highly developed. water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water.[66] some species also have dual fovea. birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (uv) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones.[99] they also have double cones, likely to mediate achromatic vision.[100] many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers.[101] ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the uv reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents.[102] with the exception of pigeons and a few other species,[103] the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking. instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally.[104] the nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds.[66] the bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.[66] eyes of most birds are large, not very round and capable of only limited movement in the orbits,[66] typically 10-20°.[105] birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field.[106][105] the avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the asio, bubo and otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. the inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.[107] a few species are able to use chemical defences against predators; some procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant stomach oil against an aggressor,[108] and some species of pitohuis from new guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in their skin and feathers.[109] a lack of field observations limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death.[110] the screamers (anhimidae), some jacanas (jacana, hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (plectropterus), the torrent duck (merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. the steamer ducks (tachyeres), geese and swans (anserinae), the solitaire (pezophaps), sheathbills (chionis), some guans (crax) and stone curlews (burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents.[110] the jacanas actophilornis and irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. the extinct xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail. swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.[110] feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). they facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling.[66] there are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes. feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. the distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics. the arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status,[111] and sex.[112] plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the ""non-breeding"" plumage, or—in the humphrey–parkes terminology—""basic"" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the humphrey–parkes system as ""alternate"" plumages.[113] moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years. moulting patterns vary across species. in passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first. when the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop. after the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult). the greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.[114] a small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless.[115] as a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair.[114] centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the phasianidae.[116] the centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail.[114][117] the general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward.[118] before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. the skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.[119] feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily, spending an average of around 9% of their daily time on this.[120] the bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria.[121] this may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting, to remove feather parasites.[122] the scales of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. they are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus, but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. most bird scales do not overlap significantly, except in the cases of kingfishers and woodpeckers. the scales of birds are thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals.[123] most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.[66] wing shape and size generally determine a bird's flight style and performance; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. about 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds.[124] flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators.[125] although flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to ""fly"" through the water, as do some flight-capable birds such as auks, shearwaters and dippers.[126] most birds are diurnal, but some birds, such as many species of owls and nightjars, are nocturnal or crepuscular (active during twilight hours), and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate, by day or night.[127] birds' diets are varied and often include nectar, fruit, plants, seeds, carrion, and various small animals, including other birds.[66] the digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth.[128] most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight.[129] some migratory birds have adapted to use protein stored in many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.[130] birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists.[66] avian foraging strategies can vary widely by species. many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes.[131] combined, insectivorous birds eat 400–500 million metric tons of arthropods annually.[132] nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers.[133] kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches.[66][134] loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion,[58] while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders.[135][136] geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers. some species, including frigatebirds, gulls,[137] and skuas,[138] engage in kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%.[139] other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.[140] water is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of sweat glands reduces the physiological demands.[141] some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. they may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting.[142] seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.[143] most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat. some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads.[144] some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers.[145] some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. the pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.[146] feathers, being critical to the survival of a bird, require maintenance. apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and bird lice.[147] the physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland. birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. while some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. a behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.[148][149] many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. these migrations vary among the different groups. many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long-distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. these birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.[150][151] migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling. landbirds have a flight range of around 2,500 km (1,600 mi) and shorebirds can fly up to 4,000 km (2,500 mi),[66] although the bar-tailed godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi).[152] seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in new zealand and chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the north pacific off japan, alaska and california, an annual round trip of 64,000 km (39,800 mi).[153] other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route. albatrosses nesting in the southern ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.[154] some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. this type of migration is normally associated with food availability.[155] species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates.[156] partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory.[157] altitudinal migration is a form of short-distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. it is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food.[158] some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.[159] the ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s, a manx shearwater released in boston in the united states returned to its colony in skomer, in wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi).[160] birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. for diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock.[66] orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding polaris.[161] these are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.[162] birds communicate using primarily visual and auditory signals. signals can be interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species). birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance,[163] to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks.[164] variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. these displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds.[66] the most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where ""dances"" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements;[165] males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.[166] bird calls and songs, which are produced in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. this communication can be very complex; some species can operate the two sides of the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.[89] calls are used for a variety of purposes, including mate attraction,[66] evaluation of potential mates,[167] bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories,[66] the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season),[168] and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat.[169] some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. the coenocorypha snipes of new zealand drive air through their feathers,[170] woodpeckers drum for long-distance communication,[171] and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.[172] while some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. the principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency.[66] defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. this has led to the development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources.[174] costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.[175] birds sometimes also form associations with non-avian species. plunge-diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish towards the surface.[176] hornbills have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses, in which they forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.[177] the high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times. sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening ""peeks"", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats.[178] swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight.[179] it has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight.[180] some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. the birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock. this may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. this adaptation is also known from marine mammals.[181] communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators.[182] roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.[183] many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep. many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. a few parrots of the genus loriculus roost hanging upside down.[184] some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates.[185] this physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. one species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation.[186] birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves. ninety-five per cent of bird species are socially monogamous. these species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate.[188] monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing.[189] among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common.[190] such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.[191] for females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate.[192] males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.[193] other mating systems, including polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity, also occur.[66] polygamous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males.[66] some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances. breeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male.[194] most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song. some displays, however, are quite elaborate. depending on the species, these may include wing or tail drumming, dancing, aerial flights, or communal lekking. females are generally the ones that drive partner selection,[195] although in the polyandrous phalaropes, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females.[196] courtship feeding, billing and allopreening are commonly performed between partners, generally after the birds have paired and mated.[197] homosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds, including copulation, pair-bonding, and joint parenting of chicks.[198] over 130 avian species around the world engage in sexual interactions between the same sex or homosexual behaviors. ""same-sex courtship activities may involve elaborate displays, synchronized dances, gift-giving ceremonies, or behaviors at specific display areas including bowers, arenas, or leks.""[199] many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks. species that are unable to defend feeding territories, such as seabirds and swifts, often breed in colonies instead; this is thought to offer protection from predators. colonial breeders defend small nesting sites, and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense.[200] all birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate.[66] hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs. there are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.[201] bird eggs are usually laid in a nest. most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows.[202] some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; albatross nests are no more than a scrape on the ground. most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds—which are more capable of defence—may build more open nests. during nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival,[203] and feathers are often used for nest insulation.[202] some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. the absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial. incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.[66] in monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation.[204] the warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.[205] incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).[66] the diversity of characteristics of birds is great, sometimes even in closely related species. several avian characteristics are compared in the table below.[206][207] at the time of their hatching, chicks range in development from helpless to independent, depending on their species. helpless chicks are termed altricial, and tend to be born small, blind, immobile and naked; chicks that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed precocial. altricial chicks need help thermoregulating and must be brooded for longer than precocial chicks. the young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the precocial or altricial category, having some aspects of each and thus fall somewhere on an ""altricial-precocial spectrum"".[208] chicks at neither extreme but favoring one or the other may be termed semi-precocial[209] or semi-altricial.[210] the length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species. at one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.[211] at the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take up to six months to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months.[212] the chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. the main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.[213] in some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex. in some species, other members of the same species—usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods—will help with the raising of the young.[214] such alloparenting is particularly common among the corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, australian magpie and fairy-wrens,[215] but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite. among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare. in birds, however, it is quite common—more so than in any other vertebrate class.[66] although territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.[216] the point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically. the chicks of the synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.[217] some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. in most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly. the amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging.[218] chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.[219] brood parasitism, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.[220] after a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood. brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young.[221] one hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos.[220] some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.[222] birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviours, with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the fisherian runaway. commonly occurring sexual dimorphisms such as size and colour differences are energetically costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations.[223] many types of avian sexual selection have been identified; intersexual selection, also known as female choice; and intrasexual competition, where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate. sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual's fitness. conflicts between an individual fitness and signalling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and courtship behaviour are ""honest"" traits. signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviours.[224] inbreeding causes early death (inbreeding depression) in the zebra finch taeniopygia guttata.[225] embryo survival (that is, hatching success of fertile eggs) was significantly lower for sib-sib mating pairs than for unrelated pairs. darwin's finch geospiza scandens experiences inbreeding depression (reduced survival of offspring) and the magnitude of this effect is influenced by environmental conditions such as low food availability.[226] incestuous matings by the purple-crowned fairy wren malurus coronatus result in severe fitness costs due to inbreeding depression (greater than 30% reduction in hatchability of eggs).[227] females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings (see promiscuity#other animals for 90% frequency in avian species) that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding. however, there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings. nevertheless, 43% of broods produced by incestuously paired females contained extra pair young.[227] inbreeding depression occurs in the great tit (parus major) when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. in natural populations of parus major, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.[228] southern pied babblers turdoides bicolor appear to avoid inbreeding in two ways. the first is through dispersal, and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates.[229] although both males and females disperse locally, they move outside the range where genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered. within their group, individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite-sex breeder is unrelated. cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin.[230] female offspring rarely stay at home, dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently, or to join unrelated groups. in general, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.[231] cross-fertilisation between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.[232][233] birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.[173] while some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds. some nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators, and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal.[234] plants and pollinating birds often coevolve,[235] and in some cases a flower's primary pollinator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar.[236] birds are often important to island ecology. birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. for example, in new zealand nine species of moa were important browsers, as are the kererū and kokako today.[234] today the plants of new zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa.[237] nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil[238] and the surrounding seas.[239] a wide variety of avian ecology field methods, including counts, nest monitoring, and capturing and marking, are used for researching avian ecology. since birds are highly visible and common animals, humans have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man.[240] sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and african peoples such as the borana.[241] other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow[242] have benefited from human activities. several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests,[243] and some pose an aviation hazard.[244] human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills[245] and predation by pet cats and dogs are common causes of death for birds).[246] birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances. some of these are zoonotic diseases that can also be transmitted to humans.[247] domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called poultry, are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, 76 million tons of poultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide.[248] chickens account for much of human poultry consumption, though domesticated turkeys, ducks, and geese are also relatively common. many species of birds are also hunted for meat. bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas. the most important birds hunted in north and south america are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include pheasants, wild turkeys, quail, doves, partridge, grouse, snipe, and woodcock.[249] muttonbirding is also popular in australia and new zealand.[250] although some hunting, such as that of muttonbirds, may be sustainable, hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species.[251] other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers (especially the down of geese and ducks), which are used as insulation in clothing and bedding, and seabird faeces (guano), which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen. the war of the pacific, sometimes called the guano war, was fought in part over the control of guano deposits.[252] birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes. colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species.[253] falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing, respectively. messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 ad, remained important as recently as world war ii. today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism,[254] or for sports such as pigeon racing. amateur bird enthusiasts (called birdwatchers, twitchers or, more commonly, birders) number in the millions.[255] many homeowners erect bird feeders near their homes to attract various species. bird feeding has grown into a multimillion-dollar industry; for example, an estimated 75% of households in britain provide food for birds at some point during the winter.[256] birds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology. in religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity, such as in the cult of makemake, in which the tangata manu of easter island served as chiefs[257] or as attendants, as in the case of hugin and munin, the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the norse god odin. in several civilisations of ancient italy, particularly etruscan and roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the ""auspex"" (from which the word ""auspicious"" is derived) watched their activities to foretell events.[258] they may also serve as religious symbols, as when jonah (hebrew: יוֹנָה‎, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves.[259] birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the common peacock, which is perceived as mother earth by the people of southern india.[260] in the ancient world, doves were used as symbols of the mesopotamian goddess inanna (later known as ishtar),[261][262] the canaanite mother goddess asherah,[261][262][263] and the greek goddess aphrodite.[264][265][261][262][266] in ancient greece, athena, the goddess of wisdom and patron deity of the city of athens, had a little owl as her symbol.[267][268][269] in religious images preserved from the inca and tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms.[270] indigenous peoples of the central andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.[270] birds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times, when they were represented in early cave paintings.[271] some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological roc and the māori's legendary pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans.[272] birds were later used as symbols of power, as in the magnificent peacock throne of the mughal and persian emperors.[273] with the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books. among the most famous of these bird artists was john james audubon, whose paintings of north american birds were a great commercial success in europe and who later lent his name to the national audubon society.[274] birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, homer incorporated nightingales into his odyssey, and catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his catullus 2.[275] the relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of samuel taylor coleridge's the rime of the ancient mariner, which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a 'burden'.[276] other english metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.[277] perceptions of bird species vary across cultures. owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of africa,[278] but are regarded as wise across much of europe.[279] hoopoes were considered sacred in ancient egypt and symbols of virtue in persia, but were thought of as thieves across much of europe and harbingers of war in scandinavia.[280] in heraldry, birds, especially eagles, often appear in coats of arms.[281] in music, birdsong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as vivaldi, messiaen, and beethoven did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as ottorino respighi first did; or like beatrice harrison and david rothenberg, they can duet with birds.[282][283][284][285] although human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the barn swallow and european starling, they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species. over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times,[286] although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750–1800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of melanesian, polynesian, and micronesian islands.[287] many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227 species listed as threatened by birdlife international and the iucn in 2009.[288][289] the most commonly cited human threat to birds is habitat loss.[290] other threats include overhunting, accidental mortality due to collisions with buildings or vehicles, long-line fishing bycatch,[291] pollution (including oil spills and pesticide use),[292] competition and predation from nonnative invasive species,[293] and climate change. governments and conservation groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for reintroductions. such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the california condor and norfolk parakeet.[294] "
duck," see text duck is the common name for numerous species in the waterfowl family anatidae which also includes swans and geese. ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the family anatidae; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water. ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules and coots. the word duck comes from old english dūce ""diver"", a derivative of the verb *dūcan ""to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or dive"", because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare with dutch duiken and german tauchen ""to dive"". this word replaced old english ened/ænid ""duck"", possibly to avoid confusion with other old english words, like ende ""end"" with similar forms. other germanic languages still have similar words for ""duck"", for example, dutch eend ""duck"", german ente ""duck"" and norwegian and ""duck"". the word ened/ænid was inherited from proto-indo-european; compare: latin anas ""duck"", lithuanian ántis ""duck"", ancient greek nēssa/nētta (νῆσσα, νῆττα) ""duck"", and sanskrit ātí ""water bird"", among others. a duckling is a young duck in downy plumage[1] or baby duck,[2] but in the food trade a young domestic duck which has just reached adult size and bulk and its meat is still fully tender, is sometimes labelled as a duckling. a male duck is called a drake and the female is called a duck, or in ornithology a hen.[3][4] the overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and the ducks are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese and swans. the body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded. the bill is usually broad and contains serrated pectens, which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species. in the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly serrated. the scaled legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic species. the wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. three species of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting; they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. this moult typically precedes migration. the drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance, the ""eclipse"" plumage. southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism, although there are exceptions such as the paradise shelduck of new zealand, which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and in which the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. the plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female. over the course of evolution, female ducks have evolved to have a corkscrew shaped vagina to prevent rape. ducks eat a variety of food sources such as grasses, aquatic plants, fish, insects, small amphibians, worms, and small molluscs. dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging.[5] along the edge of the beak, there is a comb-like structure called a pecten. this strains the water squirting from the side of the beak and traps any food. the pecten is also used to preen feathers and to hold slippery food items. diving ducks and sea ducks forage deep underwater. to be able to submerge more easily, the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly. a few specialized species such as the mergansers are adapted to catch and swallow large fish. the others have the characteristic wide flat beak adapted to dredging-type jobs such as pulling up waterweed, pulling worms and small molluscs out of mud, searching for insect larvae, and bulk jobs such as dredging out, holding, turning head first, and swallowing a squirming frog. to avoid injury when digging into sediment it has no cere, but the nostrils come out through hard horn. the guardian (british newspaper) published an article advising that ducks should not be fed with bread because it damages the health of the ducks and pollutes waterways.[6] ducks generally only have one partner at a time, although the partnership usually only lasts one year.[7] larger species and the more sedentary species (like fast-river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last numerous years.[8] most duck species breed once a year, choosing to do so in favourable conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons). ducks also tend to make a nest before breeding, and, after hatching, lead their ducklings to water. mother ducks are very caring and protective of their young, but may abandon some of their ducklings if they are physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of (such as nesting in an enclosed courtyard) or are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation, or disease. ducklings can also be orphaned by inconsistent late hatching where a few eggs hatch after the mother has abandoned the nest and led her ducklings to water.[9] most domestic ducks neglect their eggs and ducklings, and their eggs must be hatched under a broody hen or artificially. female mallard ducks (as well as several other species in the genus anas, such as the american and pacific black ducks) make the classic ""quack"" sound while males make a similar but raspier sound that is sometimes written as ""breeeeze"",[10][self-published source?] but, despite widespread misconceptions, most species of duck do not ""quack"".[11] in general, ducks make a wide range of calls, ranging from whistles, cooing, yodels and grunts. for example, the scaup – which are diving ducks – make a noise like ""scaup"" (hence their name). calls may be loud displaying calls or quieter contact calls. a common urban legend claims that duck quacks do not echo; however, this has been proven to be false. this myth was first debunked by the acoustics research centre at the university of salford in 2003 as part of the british association's festival of science.[12] it was also debunked in one of the earlier episodes of the popular discovery channel television show mythbusters.[13] the ducks have a cosmopolitan distribution. a number of species manage to live on sub-antarctic islands like south georgia and the auckland islands. numerous ducks have managed to establish themselves on oceanic islands such as hawaii, new zealand and kerguelen, although many of these species and populations are threatened or have become extinct. some duck species, mainly those breeding in the temperate and arctic northern hemisphere, are migratory; those in the tropics, however, are generally not. some ducks, particularly in australia where rainfall is patchy and erratic, are nomadic, seeking out the temporary lakes and pools that form after localised heavy rain.[14] worldwide, ducks have many predators. ducklings are particularly vulnerable, since their inability to fly makes them easy prey not only for predatory birds but also for large fish like pike, crocodilians, predatory testudines such as the alligator snapping turtle, and other aquatic hunters, including fish-eating birds such as herons. ducks' nests are raided by land-based predators, and brooding females may be caught unaware on the nest by mammals, such as foxes, or large birds, such as hawks or owls. adult ducks are fast fliers, but may be caught on the water by large aquatic predators including big fish such as the north american muskie and the european pike. in flight, ducks are safe from all but a few predators such as humans and the peregrine falcon, which regularly uses its speed and strength to catch ducks. ducks have many economic uses, being farmed for their meat, eggs, and feathers (particularly their down). approximately 3 billion ducks are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.[15] they are also kept and bred by aviculturists and often displayed in zoos. almost all the varieties of domestic ducks are descended from the mallard (anas platyrhynchos), apart from the muscovy duck (cairina moschata).[16][17] the call duck is another example of a domestic duck breed. its name comes from its original use established by hunters, as a decoy to attract wild mallards from the sky, into traps set for them on the ground. the call duck is the world's smallest domestic duck breed, as it weighs less than 1 kg (2.2 lb).[18] in many areas, wild ducks of various species (including ducks farmed and released into the wild) are hunted for food or sport,[19] by shooting, or formerly by being trapped using duck decoys. because an idle floating duck or a duck squatting on land cannot react to fly or move quickly, ""a sitting duck"" has come to mean ""an easy target"". these ducks may be contaminated by pollutants such as pcbs.[20] in 2002, psychologist richard wiseman and colleagues at the university of hertfordshire, uk, finished a year-long laughlab experiment, concluding that of all animals, ducks attract the most humor and silliness; he said, ""if you're going to tell a joke involving an animal, make it a duck.""[21] the word ""duck"" may have become an inherently funny word in many languages, possibly because ducks are seen as silly in their looks or behavior. of the many ducks in fiction, many are cartoon characters, such as walt disney's donald duck, and warner bros.' daffy duck. howard the duck started as a comic book character in 1973 and was made into a movie in 1986. the 1992 disney film the mighty ducks, starring emilio estevez, chose the duck as the mascot for the fictional youth hockey team who are protagonists of the movie, based on the duck being described as a fierce fighter. this led to the duck becoming the nickname and mascot for the eventual national hockey league professional team of the anaheim ducks, who were founded with the name the mighty ducks of anaheim. the duck is also the nickname of the university of oregon sports teams as well as the long island ducks minor league baseball team.[citation needed] "
bat," (traditional): (present): bats are mammals of the order chiroptera.[a] with their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight. bats are more manoeuvrable than birds, flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium. the smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 millimetres (1 1⁄8–1 3⁄8 inches) in length, 150 mm (6 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (1⁄16–3⁄32 oz) in mass. the largest bats are the flying foxes and the giant golden-crowned flying fox, acerodon jubatus, which can weigh 1.6 kg (3 1⁄2 lb) and have a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in). the second largest order of mammals after rodents, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,400 species. these were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats. but more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera, with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats. many bats are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters) or nectarivores (nectar-eaters). a few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the vampire bats feed on blood. most bats are nocturnal, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators. bats are present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions. they are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services. bats provide humans with some direct benefits, at the cost of some disadvantages. on the benefits side, bat dung has been and in many places still is mined as guano from caves and used as fertiliser. bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for pesticides and other insect management measures. they are sometimes numerous enough and close enough to human settlements to serve as tourist attractions, and they are used as food across asia and the pacific rim. on the disadvantages side, fruit bats are frequently considered pests by fruit growers. due to their physiology, bats are one type of animal that acts as a natural reservoir of many pathogens, such as rabies; and since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread disease among themselves. if humans interact with bats, these traits become potentially dangerous to humans. depending on the culture, bats may be symbolically associated with positive traits, such as protection from certain diseases or risks, rebirth, or long life, but in the west, bats are popularly associated with darkness, malevolence, witchcraft, vampires, and death. an older english name for bats is flittermouse, which matches their name in other germanic languages (for example german fledermaus and swedish fladdermus), related to the fluttering of wings. middle english had bakke, most likely cognate with old swedish natbakka (""night-bat""), which may have undergone a shift from -k- to -t- (to modern english bat) influenced by latin blatta, ""moth, nocturnal insect"". the word ""bat"" was probably first used in the early 1570s.[2][3] the name ""chiroptera"" derives from ancient greek: χείρ – cheir, ""hand""[4] and πτερόν – pteron, ""wing"".[1][5] the delicate skeletons of bats do not fossilise well; it is estimated that only 12% of bat genera that lived have been found in the fossil record.[6] most of the oldest known bat fossils were already very similar to modern microbats, such as archaeopteropus (32 million years ago).[7] the extinct bats palaeochiropteryx tupaiodon (48 million years ago) and hassianycteris kumari (55 million years ago) are the first fossil mammals whose colouration has been discovered: both were reddish-brown.[8][9] bats were formerly grouped in the superorder archonta, along with the treeshrews (scandentia), colugos (dermoptera), and primates.[10] modern genetic evidence now places bats in the superorder laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed ungulates, even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans.[11][12][13][14][15] one study places chiroptera as a sister taxon to odd-toed ungulates (perissodactyla).[16] euarchontoglires (primates, treeshrews, rodents, rabbits) eulipotyphla (hedgehogs, shrews, moles, solenodons) chiroptera (bats) pholidota (pangolins) carnivora (cats, hyenas, dogs, bears, seals) perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, rhinos) cetartiodactyla (camels, ruminants, whales) the phylogenetic relationships of the different groups of bats have been the subject of much debate. the traditional subdivision into megachiroptera and microchiroptera reflected the view that these groups of bats had evolved independently of each other for a long time, from a common ancestor already capable of flight. this hypothesis recognised differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has evolved only once in mammals. most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a natural or monophyletic group.[7] pteropodidae (megabats) megadermatidae (false vampire bats) craseonycteridae (kitti's hog-nosed bat) rhinopomatidae (mouse-tailed bats) hipposideridae (old world leaf-nosed bats) rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats) miniopteridae (long winged bat) noctilionidae (fisherman bats) mormoopidae (pteronotus) mystacinidae (new zealand short-tailed bats) thyropteridae (disc-winged bats) furipteridae mormoopidae (mormoops) phyllostomidae (new world leaf-nosed bats) molossidae (free-tailed bats) emballonuridae (sac-winged bats) myzopodidae (sucker-footed bats) emballonuridae (taphozous) natalidae (funnel-eared bats) vespertilionidae (vesper bats) genetic evidence indicates that megabats originated during the early eocene, and belong within the four major lines of microbats.[15] two new suborders have been proposed; yinpterochiroptera includes the pteropodidae, or megabat family, as well as the families rhinolophidae, hipposideridae, craseonycteridae, megadermatidae, and rhinopomatidae.[18] yangochiroptera includes the other families of bats (all of which use laryngeal echolocation), a conclusion supported by a 2005 dna study.[18] a 2013 phylogenomic study supported the two new proposed suborders.[15] yangochiroptera (as above) pteropodidae (megabats) megadermatidae (false vampire bats) horseshoe bats and allies in the 1980s, a hypothesis based on morphological evidence stated the megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the microchiroptera. the flying primate hypothesis proposed that, when adaptations to flight are removed, the megachiroptera are allied to primates by anatomical features not shared with microchiroptera. for example, the brains of megabats have advanced characteristics. although recent genetic studies strongly support the monophyly of bats,[7] debate continues about the meaning of the genetic and morphological evidence.[19] the 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52-million-year-old green river formation, onychonycteris finneyi, indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities.[20][21] onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. it also had longer hind legs and shorter forearms, similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches, such as sloths and gibbons. this palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. instead of flapping its wings continuously while flying, onychonycteris probably alternated between flaps and glides in the air.[7] this suggests that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats, but flew from tree to tree and spent most of its time climbing or hanging on branches.[22] the distinctive features of the onychonycteris fossil also support the hypothesis that mammalian flight most likely evolved in arboreal locomotors, rather than terrestrial runners. this model of flight development, commonly known as the ""trees-down"" theory, holds that bats first flew by taking advantage of height and gravity to drop down on to prey, rather than running fast enough for a ground-level take off.[23][24] the molecular phylogeny was controversial, as it pointed to microbats not having a unique common ancestry, which implied that some seemingly unlikely transformations occurred. the first is that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice in bats, once in yangochiroptera and once in the rhinolophoids.[25] the second is that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in chiroptera, was subsequently lost in the family pteropodidae (all megabats), and later evolved as a system of tongue-clicking in the genus rousettus.[26] analyses of the sequence of the vocalization gene foxp2 were inconclusive on whether laryngeal echolocation was lost in the pteropodids or gained in the echolocating lineages.[27] echolocation probably first derived in bats from communicative calls. the eocene bats icaronycteris (52 million years ago) and palaeochiropteryx had cranial adaptations suggesting an ability to detect ultrasound. this may have been used at first mainly to forage on the ground for insects and map out their surroundings in their gliding phase, or for communicative purposes. after the adaptation of flight was established, it may have been refined to target flying prey by echolocation.[22] bats may have evolved echolocation through a shared common ancestor, in which case it was then lost in the old world megabats, only to be regained in the horseshoe bats; or, echolocation evolved independently in both the yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera lineages.[28] analyses of the hearing gene prestin seem to favour the idea that echolocation developed independently at least twice, rather than being lost secondarily in the pteropodids,[29] but ontogenic analysis of the cochlea supports that laryngeal echolocation evolved only once.[30] bats are placental mammals. after rodents, they are the largest order, making up about 20% of mammal species.[31] in 1758, carl linnaeus classified the seven bat species he knew of in the genus vespertilio in the order primates. around twenty years later, the german naturalist johann friedrich blumenbach gave them their own order, chiroptera.[32] since then, the number of described species has risen to over 1,400,[33] traditionally classified as two suborders: megachiroptera (megabats), and microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats).[34] not all megabats are larger than microbats.[35] several characteristics distinguish the two groups. microbats use echolocation for navigation and finding prey, but megabats apart from those in the genus rousettus do not, relying instead on their eyesight.[36] accordingly, megabats have a well-developed visual cortex and good visual acuity.[34] megabats have a claw on the second finger of the forelimb.[37][38] the external ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear.[38] megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen, while most microbats eat insects; others feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or blood.[34] below is a table chart following the bat classification of families recognized by various authors of the ninth volume of handbook of the mammals of the world published in 2019:[39] the head and teeth shape of bats can vary by species. in general, megabats have longer snouts, larger eye sockets and smaller ears, giving them a more dog-like appearance, which is the source of their nickname of ""flying foxes"".[40] among microbats, longer snouts are associated with nectar-feeding.[41] while vampire bats have reduced snouts to accommodate large incisors and canines.[42] small insect-eating bats can have as many as 38 teeth, while vampire bats have only 20. bats that feed on hard-shelled insects have fewer but larger teeth with longer canines and more robust lower jaws than species that prey on softer bodied insects. in nectar-feeding bats, the canines are long while the cheek-teeth are reduced. in fruit-eating bats, the cusps of the cheek teeth are adapted for crushing.[41] the upper incisors of vampire bats lack enamel, which keeps them razor-sharp.[42] the bite force of small bats is generated through mechanical advantage, allowing them to bite through the hardened armour of insects or the skin of fruit.[43] bats are the only mammals capable of sustained flight, as opposed to gliding, as in the flying squirrel.[44] the fastest bat, the mexican free-tailed bat (tadarida brasiliensis), can achieve a ground speed of 160 km/h (100 mph).[45] the finger bones of bats are much more flexible than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of calcium near their tips. the elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, is due to the upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps). during embryonic development, the gene controlling bmp signalling, bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs – resulting in the extension of the manual digits. this crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialised limbs required for powered flight. the relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of eocene fossil bats have no significant differences, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over fifty million years.[46] during flight, the bones undergo bending and shearing stress; the bending stresses felt are smaller than in terrestrial mammals, but the shearing stress is larger. the wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.[47] as in other mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius is the main component of the forearm. bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. the thumb points forward and supports the leading edge of the wing, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. the second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against aerodynamic drag, without having to be thick as in pterosaur wings. the fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane.[48] due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dexterous than gliding mammals.[49] the wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than the wings of birds, allowing bats to manoeuvre more accurately than the latter, and fly with more lift and less drag.[50] by folding the wings in toward their bodies on the upstroke, they save 35 percent energy during flight.[51] the membranes are delicate, tearing easily,[52] but can regrow, and small tears heal quickly.[52][53] the surface of the wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called merkel cells, also found on human fingertips. these sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the centre, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and adapt to changing airflow; the primary use is to judge the most efficient speed at which to fly, and possibly also to avoid stalls.[54] insectivorous bats may also use tactile hairs to help perform complex manoeuvres to capture prey in flight.[49] the patagium is the wing membrane; it is stretched between the arm and finger bones, and down the side of the body to the hind limbs and tail. this skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibres, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. the muscles keep the membrane taut during flight.[55] the extent to which the tail of a bat is attached to a patagium can vary by species, with some having completely free tails or even no tails.[41] the skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, is very different from the skin of the wing membrane. the patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue centre, rich with collagen and elastic fibres. the membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers.[54][56] for bat embryos, apoptosis (cell death) affects only the hindlimbs, while the forelimbs retain webbing between the digits that forms into the wing membranes.[57] unlike birds, whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane that can resist only tension. to achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspans, unlike birds, which can partly fold their wings in flight, radically reducing the wing span and area for the upstroke and for gliding. hence bats cannot travel over long distances as birds can.[48] nectar- and pollen-eating bats can hover, in a similar way to hummingbirds. the sharp leading edges of the wings can create vortices, which provide lift. the vortex may be stabilised by the animal changing its wing curvatures.[58] when not flying, bats hang upside down from their feet, a posture known as roosting.[59] the femurs are attached at the hips in a way that allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. the ankle joint can flex to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. this does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees.[48] most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. this difference is reflected in the structure of the cervical or neck vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct.[59] tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.[60] when on the ground, most bats can only crawl awkwardly. a few species such as the new zealand lesser short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground. both species make lateral gaits (the limbs move one after the other) when moving slowly but vampire bats move with a bounding gait (all limbs move in unison) at greater speeds, the folded up wings being used to propel them forward. vampire bat likely evolved these gaits to follow their hosts while short-tailed bats developed in the absence of terrestrial mammal competitors. enhanced terrestrial locomotion does not appear to have reduced their ability to fly.[61] bats have an efficient circulatory system. they seem to make use of particularly strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. in most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action.[62][63] since their bodies are relatively small and lightweight, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.[64] bats possess a highly adapted respiratory system to cope with the demands of powered flight, an energetically taxing activity that requires a large continuous throughput of oxygen. in bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are larger than in most other small quadrupedal mammals.[65] during flight the respiratory cycle has a one-to-one relationship with the wing-beat cycle.[66] because of the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.[48] it takes a lot of energy and an efficient circulatory system to work the flight muscles of bats. energy supply to the muscles engaged in flight require about double the amount compared to the muscles that do not use flight as a means of mammalian locomotion. in parallel to energy consumption, blood oxygen levels of flying animals are twice as much as those of their terrestrially locomoting mammals. as the blood supply controls the amount of oxygen supplied throughout the body, the circulatory system must respond accordingly. therefore, compared to a terrestrial mammal of the same relative size, the bat's heart can be up to three times larger, and pump more blood.[68] cardiac output is directly derived from heart rate and stroke volume of the blood;[69] an active microbat can reach a heart rate of 1000 beats per minute.[70] with its extremely thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing can significantly contribute to the organism's total gas exchange efficiency.[56] because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. when the bat has its wings spread it allows for an increase in surface area to volume ratio. the surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful degree of gas exchange.[56] the subcutaneous vessels in the membrane lie very close to the surface and allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.[71] the digestive system of bats has varying adaptations depending on the species of bat and its diet. as in other flying animals, food is processed quickly and effectively to keep up with the energy demand. insectivorous bats may have certain digestive enzymes to better process insects, such as chitinase to break down chitin, which is a large component of insects.[72] vampire bats, probably due to their diet of blood, are the only vertebrates that do not have the enzyme maltase, which breaks down malt sugar, in their intestinal tract. nectivorous and frugivorous bats have more maltase and sucrase enzymes than insectivorous, to cope with the higher sugar contents of their diet.[73] the adaptations of the kidneys of bats vary with their diets. carnivorous and vampire bats consume large amounts of protein and can output concentrated urine; their kidneys have a thin cortex and long renal papillae. frugivorous bats lack that ability and have kidneys adapted for electrolyte-retention due to their low-electrolyte diet; their kidneys accordingly have a thick cortex and very short conical papillae.[73] bats have higher metabolic rates associated with flying, which lead to an increased respiratory water loss. their large wings are composed of the highly vascularized membranes, increasing the surface area, and leading to cutaneous evaporative water loss.[67] water helps maintain their ionic balance in their blood, thermoregulation system, and removal of wastes and toxins from the body via urine. they are also susceptible to blood urea poisoning if they do not receive enough fluid.[74] the structure of the uterine system in female bats can vary by species, with some having two uterine horns while others have a single mainline chamber.[75] microbats and a few megabats emit ultrasonic sounds to produce echoes. sound intensity of these echos are dependent on subglottic pressure. the bats' cricothyroid muscle controls the orientation pulse frequency, which is an important function. this muscle is located inside the larynx and it is the only tensor muscle capable of aiding phonation.[76] by comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, the brain and auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. this allows bats to detect, localise, and classify their prey in darkness. bat calls are some of the loudest airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from 60 to 140 decibels.[77][78] microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit it through the mouth and sometimes the nose. the latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (rhinolophus spp.). microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000 hz, extending well beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000 hz).[79] various groups of bats have evolved fleshy extensions around and above the nostrils, known as nose-leaves, which play a role in sound transmission.[80] in low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can separate their calls and returning echoes by time. they have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. the time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can hear the returning echo.[81] the delay of the returning echoes allows the bat to estimate the range to their prey.[79] in high-duty cycle echolocation, bats emit a continuous call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. the ears of these bats are sharply tuned to a specific frequency range. they emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. they then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range by taking advantage of the doppler shift of their motion in flight. the doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. these bats must deal with changes in the doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. they have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.[82] in addition to echolocating prey, bat ears are sensitive to the fluttering of moth wings, the sounds produced by tymbalate insects, and the movement of ground-dwelling prey, such as centipedes and earwigs. the complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of bat ears helps to sharply focus echolocation signals, and to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey. these ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and exist in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as the aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur, and others.[83][84][85] bats can estimate the elevation of their target using the interference patterns from the echoes reflecting from the tragus, a flap of skin in the external ear.[79] by repeated scanning, bats can mentally construct an accurate image of the environment in which they are moving and of their prey.[88] some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths, which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected and therefore distasteful.[86][87] moth species including the tiger moth can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive manoeuvres.[89][90][91] the eyes of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, but no species is blind.[92] most microbats have mesopic vision, meaning that they can detect light only in low levels, whereas other mammals have photopic vision, which allows colour vision. microbats may use their vision for orientation and while travelling between their roosting grounds and feeding grounds, as echolocation is effective only over short distances. some species can detect ultraviolet (uv). as the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, they may be able to discriminate colours.[44][93][94][95] megabat species often have eyesight as good as, if not better than, human vision. their eyesight is adapted to both night and daylight vision, including some colour vision.[95] microbats make use of magnetoreception, in that they have a high sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field, as birds do. microbats use a polarity-based compass, meaning that they differentiate north from south, unlike birds, which use the strength of the magnetic field to differentiate latitudes, which may be used in long-distance travel. the mechanism is unknown but may involve magnetite particles.[96][97] most bats are homeothermic (having a stable body temperature), the exception being the vesper bats (vespertilionidae), the horseshoe bats (rhinolophidae), the free-tailed bats (molossidae), and the bent-winged bats (miniopteridae), which extensively use heterothermy (where body temperature can vary).[98] compared to other mammals, bats have a high thermal conductivity. the wings are filled with blood vessels, and lose body heat when extended. at rest, they may wrap their wings around themselves to trap a layer of warm air. smaller bats generally have a higher metabolic rate than larger bats, and so need to consume more food in order to maintain homeothermy.[99] bats may avoid flying during the day to prevent overheating in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. bats may not be able to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high;[100] they use saliva to cool themselves in extreme conditions.[48] among megabats, the flying fox pteropus hypomelanus uses saliva and wing-fanning to cool itself while roosting during the hottest part of the day.[101] among microbats, the yuma myotis (myotis yumanensis), the mexican free-tailed bat, and the pallid bat (antrozous pallidus) cope with temperatures up to 45 °c (113 °f) by panting, salivating, and licking their fur to promote evaporative cooling; this is sufficient to dissipate twice their metabolic heat production.[102] bats also possess a system of sphincter valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs along the edge of their wings. when fully open, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane; when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. this allows bats to control how much heat is exchanged through the flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.[103] torpor, a state of decreased activity where the body temperature and metabolism decreases, is especially useful for microbats, as they use a large amount of energy while active, depend upon an unreliable food source, and have a limited ability to store fat. they generally drop their body temperature in this state to 6–30 °c (43–86 °f), and may reduce their energy expenditure by 50 to 99%. around 97% of all microbats use torpor.[104] tropical bats may use it to avoid predation, by reducing the amount of time spent on foraging and thus reducing the chance of being caught by a predator.[105] megabats were generally believed to be homeothermic, but three species of small megabats, with a mass of about 50 grams (1 3⁄4 ounces), have been known to use torpor: the common blossom bat (syconycteris australis), the long-tongued nectar bat (macroglossus minimus), and the eastern tube-nosed bat (nyctimene robinsoni). torpid states last longer in the summer for megabats than in the winter.[106] during hibernation, bats enter a torpid state and decrease their body temperature for 99.6% of their hibernation period; even during periods of arousal, when they return their body temperature to normal, they sometimes enter a shallow torpid state, known as ""heterothermic arousal"".[107] some bats become dormant during higher temperatures to keep cool in the summer months.[108] heterothermic bats during long migrations may fly at night and go into a torpid state roosting in the daytime. unlike migratory birds, which fly during the day and feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between travelling and eating. the energy saved reduces their need to feed, and also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from spending too much time in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. in some species, pregnant individuals may not use torpor.[109][110] the smallest bat is kitti's hog-nosed bat (craseonycteris thonglongyai), which is 29–34 mm (1 1⁄8–1 3⁄8 in) long with a 150-millimetre (6 in) wingspan and weighs 2–2.6 g (1⁄16–3⁄32 oz).[111][112] it is also arguably the smallest extant species of mammal, next to the etruscan shrew.[113] the largest bats are a few species of pteropus megabats and the giant golden-crowned flying fox, (acerodon jubatus), which can weigh 1.6 kg (3 1⁄2 lb) with a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in).[114] larger bats tend to use lower frequencies and smaller bats higher for echolocation; high-frequency echolocation is better at detecting smaller prey. small prey may be absent in the diets of large bats as they are unable to detect them.[115] the adaptations of a particular bat species can directly influence what kinds of prey are available to it.[116] flight has enabled bats to become one of the most widely distributed groups of mammals.[117] apart from the high arctic, the antarctic and a few isolated oceanic islands, bats exist in almost every habitat on earth.[118] tropical areas tend to have more species than temperate ones.[119] different species select different habitats during different seasons, ranging from seasides to mountains and deserts, but they require suitable roosts. bat roosts can be found in hollows, crevices, foliage, and even human-made structures, and include ""tents"" the bats construct with leaves.[120] megabats generally roost in trees.[121] most microbats are nocturnal[122] and megabats are typically diurnal or crepuscular.[123][124] microbats are known to exhibit diurnal behaviour in temperate regions during summer when there is insufficient night time to forage,[125][126] and in areas where there are few avian predators during the day.[127][128] in temperate areas, some microbats migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens;[129] others pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows insects to be active.[130] others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for as much as six months.[130] microbats rarely fly in rain; it interferes with their echolocation, and they are unable to hunt.[131] different bat species have different diets, including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates.[132] megabats are mostly fruit, nectar and pollen eaters.[123] due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy through flight, bats must consume large amounts of food for their size. insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight, while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight.[133] they can travel significant distances each night, exceptionally as much as 38.5 km (24 mi) in the spotted bat (euderma maculatum), in search of food.[134] bats use a variety of hunting strategies.[115] bats get most of their water from the food they eat; many species also drink from water sources like lakes and streams, flying over the surface and dipping their tongues into the water.[135] the chiroptera as a whole are in the process of losing the ability to synthesise vitamin c.[136] in a test of 34 bat species from six major families, including major insect- and fruit-eating bat families, all were found to have lost the ability to synthesise it, and this loss may derive from a common bat ancestor, as a single mutation.[137][b] at least two species of bat, the frugivorous bat (rousettus leschenaultii) and the insectivorous bat (hipposideros armiger), have retained their ability to produce vitamin c.[138] most microbats, especially in temperate areas, prey on insects.[132] the diet of an insectivorous bat may span many species,[139] including flies, mosquitos, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies.[41][140][141] large numbers of mexican free-tailed bats (tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of metres above the ground in central texas to feed on migrating moths.[142] species that hunt insects in flight, like the little brown bat (myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with the mouth, and eat it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up the insect and carry it to the mouth.[143][144] the bat may also take the insect back to its roost and eat it there.[145] slower moving bat species, such as the brown long-eared bat (plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe bat species, may take or glean insects from vegetation or hunt them from perches.[41] insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.[146] fruit eating, or frugivory, is found in both major suborders. bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. they fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and spitting the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. this helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and many species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal.[147][148] the jamaican fruit bat (artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14 g (1⁄8–1⁄2 oz) or even as much as 50 g (1 3⁄4 oz).[149] nectar-eating bats have acquired specialised adaptations. these bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants.[148][150] the tube-lipped nectar bat (anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. this is beneficial to them in terms of pollination and feeding. their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. when the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage.[150] because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than other types of bat.[151][152] nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators, as pollen gets attached to their fur while they are feeding. around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night.[148] many rainforest plants depend on bat pollination.[153] some bats prey on other vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, birds and mammals.[41][155] the fringe-lipped bat (trachops cirrhosus,) for example, is skilled at catching frogs. these bats locate large groups of frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them from the surface of the water with their sharp canine teeth.[156] the greater noctule bat can catch birds in flight.[154] some species, like the greater bulldog bat (noctilio leporinus) hunt fish. they use echolocation to detect small ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it.[157] at least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the spectral bat (vampyrum spectrum), and the ghost bat (macroderma gigas).[158] a few species, specifically the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, feed only on animal blood (hematophagy). the common vampire bat typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle; the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds.[159] vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing.[160] heat sensors in the nose help them to detect blood vessels near the surface of the skin.[161] they pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap,[162] and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose.[163] the blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.[162] bats are subject to predation from birds of prey, such as owls, hawks, and falcons, and at roosts from terrestrial predators able to climb, such as cats.[164] low-flying bats are vulnerable to crocodiles.[165] twenty species of tropical new world snakes are known to capture bats, often waiting at the entrances of refuges, such as caves, for bats to fly past.[166] j. rydell and j. r. speakman argue that bats evolved nocturnality during the early and middle eocene period to avoid predators.[164] the evidence is thought by some zoologists to be equivocal so far.[167] as most mammals, bats are hosts to a number of internal and external parasites.[168] among ectoparasites, bats carry fleas and mites, as well as specific parasites such as bat bugs and bat flies (nycteribiidae and streblidae).[169][170] bats are among the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host lice, possibly due to competition from more specialised parasites that occupy the same niche.[170] white nose syndrome is a condition associated with the deaths of millions of bats in the eastern united states and canada.[171] the disease is named after a white fungus, pseudogymnoascus destructans, found growing on the muzzles, ears, and wings of afflicted bats. the fungus is mostly spread from bat to bat, and causes the disease.[172] the fungus was first discovered in central new york state in 2006 and spread quickly to the entire eastern us north of florida; mortality rates of 90–100% have been observed in most affected caves.[173] new england and the mid-atlantic states have, since 2006, witnessed entire species completely extirpated and others with numbers that have gone from the hundreds of thousands, even millions, to a few hundred or less.[174] nova scotia, quebec, ontario, and new brunswick have witnessed identical die offs, with the canadian government making preparations to protect all remaining bat populations in its territory.[175] scientific evidence suggests that longer winters where the fungus has a longer period to infect bats result in greater mortality.[176][177][178] in 2014, the infection crossed the mississippi river,[179] and in 2017, it was found on bats in texas.[180] bats are natural reservoirs for a large number of zoonotic pathogens,[181] including rabies, endemic in many bat populations,[182][183][184] histoplasmosis both directly and in guano,[185] nipah and hendra viruses,[186][187] and possibly the ebola virus,[188][189] whose natural reservoir is yet unknown.[190][191] their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry (range overlap) of species, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease.[192] reviews have found different answers as to whether bats have more zoonotic viruses than other mammal groups. one 2015 review found that bats, rodents, and primates all harbored significantly more zoonotic viruses (which can be transmitted to humans) than other mammal groups, though the differences among the aforementioned three groups were not significant (bats have no more zoonotic viruses than rodents and primates).[193] another 2020 review of mammals and birds found that the identify of the taxonomic groups did not have any impact on the probability of harboring zoonotic viruses. instead, more diverse groups had greater viral diversity.[194] they seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to their immune systems.[192][195][196] their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.[183] bats are implicated in the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in china, since they serve as natural hosts for coronaviruses, several from a single cave in yunnan, one of which developed into the sars virus.[185][197][198] however, they neither cause nor spread covid-19.[199] some bats lead solitary lives, while others live in colonies of more than a million.[200] for instance, the mexican free-tailed bat fly for more than one thousand miles to the 100-foot wide cave known as bracken cave every march to october which plays home to an astonishing twenty million of the species,[201] whereas a mouse-eared bat lives an almost completely solitary life.[202] living in large colonies lessens the risk to an individual of predation.[41] temperate bat species may swarm at hibernation sites as autumn approaches. this may serve to introduce young to hibernation sites, signal reproduction in adults and allow adults to breed with those from other groups.[203] several species have a fission-fusion social structure, where large numbers of bats congregate in one roosting area, along with breaking up and mixing of subgroups. within these societies, bats are able to maintain long-term relationships.[204] some of these relationships consist of matrilineally related females and their dependent offspring.[205] food sharing and mutual grooming may occur in certain species, such as the common vampire bat (desmodus rotundus), and these strengthen social bonds.[206][207] bats are among the most vocal of mammals and produce calls to attract mates, find roost partners and defend resources. these calls are typically low-frequency and can travel long distances.[41][209] mexican free-tailed bats are one of the few species to ""sing"" like birds. males sing to attract females. songs have three phrases: chirps, trills and buzzes, the former having ""a"" and ""b"" syllables. bat songs are highly stereotypical but with variation in syllable number, phrase order, and phrase repetitions between individuals.[208] among greater spear-nosed bats (phyllostomus hastatus), females produce loud, broadband calls among their roost mates to form group cohesion. calls differ between roosting groups and may arise from vocal learning.[210] in a study on captive egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the directed calls could be identified by the researchers as to which individual bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched in close proximity to each other. the animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individual bats, especially those of the opposite sex.[211] in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (hypsignathus monstrosus), males produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. bats in flight make vocal signals for traffic control. greater bulldog bats honk when on a collision course with each other.[209] bats also communicate by other means. male little yellow-shouldered bats (sturnira lilium) have shoulder glands that produce a spicy odour during the breeding season. like many other species, they have hair specialised for retaining and dispersing secretions. such hair forms a conspicuous collar around the necks of the some old world megabat males. male greater sac-winged bats (saccopteryx bilineata) have sacs in their wings in which they mix body secretions like saliva and urine to create a perfume that they sprinkle on roost sites, a behaviour known as ""salting"". salting may be accompanied by singing.[209] most bat species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. males unable to claim a site are forced to live on the periphery where they have less reproductive success.[212][41] promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat.[213][214] there appears to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats.[41] in a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs.[41][215] lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice through display, is rare in bats[216] but occurs in the hammerheaded bat.[217] for temperate living bats, mating takes place in late summer and early autumn.[218] tropical bats may mate during the dry season.[219] after copulation, the male may leave behind a mating plug to block the sperm of other males and thus ensure his paternity.[220] in hibernating species, males are known to mate with females in torpor.[41] female bats use a variety of strategies to control the timing of pregnancy and the birth of young, to make delivery coincide with maximum food ability and other ecological factors. females of some species have delayed fertilisation, in which sperm is stored in the reproductive tract for several months after mating. mating occurs in late summer to early autumn but fertilisation does not occur until the following late winter to early spring. other species exhibit delayed implantation, in which the egg is fertilised after mating, but remains free in the reproductive tract until external conditions become favourable for giving birth and caring for the offspring.[221] in another strategy, fertilisation and implantation both occur, but development of the foetus is delayed until good conditions prevail. during the delayed development the mother keeps the fertilised egg alive with nutrients. this process can go on for a long period, because of the advanced gas exchange system.[222] for temperate living bats, births typically take place in may or june in the northern hemisphere; births in the southern hemisphere occur in november and december. tropical species give birth at the beginning of the rainy season.[223] in most bat species, females carry and give birth to a single pup per litter.[224] at birth, a bat pup can be up to 40 percent of the mother's weight,[41] and the pelvic girdle of the female can expand during birth as the two-halves are connected by a flexible ligament.[225] females typically give birth in a head-up or horizontal position, using gravity to make birthing easier. the young emerges rear-first, possibly to prevent the wings from getting tangled, and the female cradles it in her wing and tail membranes. in many species, females give birth and raise their young in maternity colonies and may assist each other in birthing.[226][227][225] most of the care for a young bat comes from the mother. in monogamous species, the father plays a role. allo-suckling, where a female suckles another mother's young, occurs in several species. this may serve to increase colony size in species where females return to their natal colony to breed.[41] a young bat's ability to fly coincides with the development of an adult body and forelimb length. for the little brown bat, this occurs about eighteen days after birth. weaning of young for most species takes place in under eighty days. the common vampire bat nurses its offspring beyond that and young vampire bats achieve independence later in life than other species. this is probably due to the species' blood-based diet, which is difficult to obtain on a nightly basis.[228] the maximum lifespan of bats is three-and-a-half times longer than other mammals of similar size. six species have been recorded to live over thirty years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat (plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (myotis lucifugus), brandt's bat (myotis brandti), the lesser mouse-eared bat (myotis blythii) the greater horseshoe bat (rhinolophus ferrumequinum), and the indian flying fox (pteropus giganteus).[229] one hypothesis consistent with the rate-of-living theory links this to the fact that they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer lifespan than bats that do not.[230][231] another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. bat species that give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that give birth to only a single pup. cave-roosting species may have a longer lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. a male brandt's bat was recaptured in the wild after 41 years, making it the oldest known bat.[231][232] conservation statuses of bats as of 2020 according to the iucn (1,314 species in total)[233] groups such as the bat conservation international[234] aim to increase awareness of bats' ecological roles and the environmental threats they face. in the united kingdom, all bats are protected under the wildlife and countryside acts, and disturbing a bat or its roost can be punished with a heavy fine.[235] in sarawak, malaysia, ""all bats""[236] are protected under the wildlife protection ordinance 1998,[236] but species such as the hairless bat (cheiromeles torquatus) are still eaten by the local communities.[237] humans have caused the extinction of several species of bat in modern history, the most recent being the christmas island pipistrelle (pipistrellus murrayi), which was declared extinct in 2009.[238] many people put up bat houses to attract bats.[239] the 1991 university of florida bat house is the largest occupied artificial roost in the world, with around 400,000 residents.[240] in britain, thickwalled and partly underground world war ii pillboxes have been converted to make roosts for bats,[241][242] and purpose-built bat houses are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from road or other developments.[243][244] cave gates are sometimes installed to limit human entry into caves with sensitive or endangered bat species. the gates are designed not to limit the airflow, and thus to maintain the cave's micro-ecosystem.[245] of the 47 species of bats found in the united states, 35 are known to use human structures, including buildings and bridges. fourteen species use bat houses.[246] bats are eaten in countries across africa, asia and the pacific rim. in some cases, such as in guam, flying foxes have become endangered through being hunted for food.[247] there is evidence that wind turbines create sufficient barotrauma (pressure damage) to kill bats.[248] bats have typical mammalian lungs, which are thought to be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture.[249][250][251][252][253] bats may be attracted to turbines, perhaps seeking roosts, increasing the death rate.[249] acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.[254] since bats are mammals, yet can fly, they are considered to be liminal beings in various traditions.[255] in many cultures, including in europe, bats are associated with darkness, death, witchcraft, and malevolence.[256] among native americans such as the creek, cherokee and apache, the bat is identified as a trickster.[257] in tanzania, a winged batlike creature known as popobawa is believed to be a shapeshifting evil spirit that assaults and sodomises its victims.[258] in aztec mythology, bats symbolised the land of the dead, destruction, and decay.[259][260][261] an east nigerian tale tells that the bat developed its nocturnal habits after causing the death of his partner, the bush-rat, and now hides by day to avoid arrest.[262] more positive depictions of bats exist in some cultures. in china, bats have been associated with happiness, joy and good fortune. five bats are used to symbolise the ""five blessings"": longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue and peaceful death.[263] the bat is sacred in tonga and is often considered the physical manifestation of a separable soul.[264] in the zapotec civilisation of mesoamerica, the bat god presided over corn and fertility.[265] the weird sisters in shakespeare's macbeth used the fur of a bat in their brew.[266] in western culture, the bat is often a symbol of the night and its foreboding nature. the bat is a primary animal associated with fictional characters of the night, both villainous vampires, such as count dracula and before him varney the vampire,[267] and heroes, such as the dc comics character batman.[268] kenneth oppel's silverwing novels narrate the adventures of a young bat,[269] based on the silver-haired bat of north america.[270] the bat is sometimes used as a heraldic symbol in spain and france, appearing in the coats of arms of the towns of valencia, palma de mallorca, fraga, albacete, and montchauvet.[271][272][273] three us states have an official state bat. texas and oklahoma are represented by the mexican free-tailed bat, while virginia is represented by the virginia big-eared bat (corynorhinus townsendii virginianus).[274] insectivorous bats in particular are especially helpful to farmers, as they control populations of agricultural pests and reduce the need to use pesticides. it has been estimated that bats save the agricultural industry of the united states anywhere from $3.7 billion to $53 billion per year in pesticides and damage to crops. this also prevents the overuse of pesticides, which can pollute the surrounding environment, and may lead to resistance in future generations of insects.[275] bat dung, a type of guano, is rich in nitrates and is mined from caves for use as fertiliser.[276] during the us civil war, saltpetre was collected from caves to make gunpowder; it used to be thought that this was bat guano, but most of the nitrate comes from nitrifying bacteria.[277] the congress avenue bridge in austin, texas, is the summer home to north america's largest urban bat colony, an estimated 1,500,000 mexican free-tailed bats. about 100,000 tourists a year visit the bridge at twilight to watch the bats leave the roost.[278] "
cattle," cattle, or cows (female) and bulls (male), are the most common type of large domesticated ungulates. they are a prominent modern member of the subfamily bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as bos taurus. cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat (beef or veal, see beef cattle), for milk (see dairy cattle), and for hides, which are used to make leather. they are used as riding animals and draft animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, plows and other implements). another product of cattle is their dung, which can be used to create manure or fuel. in some regions, such as parts of india, cattle have significant religious meaning. cattle, mostly small breeds such as the miniature zebu, are also kept as pets. around 10,500 years ago, cattle were domesticated from as few as 80 progenitors in central anatolia, the levant and western iran.[1] according to the food and agriculture organization (fao), there are approximately 1.5 billion cattle in the world as of 2018.[2] in 2009, cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped genome.[3] cattle were originally identified as three separate species: bos taurus, the european or ""taurine"" cattle (including similar types from africa and asia); bos indicus, the zebu; and the extinct bos primigenius, the aurochs. the aurochs is ancestral to both zebu and taurine cattle.[4] these have been reclassified as one species, bos taurus, with three subspecies: bos taurus primigenius, bos taurus indicus, and bos taurus taurus.[5][6] complicating the matter is the ability of cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. hybrid individuals and even breeds exist, not only between taurine cattle and zebu (such as the sanga cattle, bos taurus africanus), but also between one or both of these and some other members of the genus bos – yaks (the dzo or yattle[7]), banteng, and gaur. hybrids such as the beefalo breed can even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them part of the genus bos, as well.[8] the hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious – for example, genetic testing of the dwarf lulu breed, the only taurine-type cattle in nepal, found them to be a mix of taurine cattle, zebu, and yak.[9] however, cattle cannot be successfully hybridized with more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or african buffalo. the aurochs originally ranged throughout europe, north africa, and much of asia. in historical times, its range became restricted to europe, and the last known individual died in mazovia, poland, in about 1627.[10] breeders have attempted to recreate cattle of similar appearance to aurochs by crossing traditional types of domesticated cattle, creating the heck cattle breed. cattle did not originate as the term for bovine animals. it was borrowed from anglo-norman catel, itself from medieval latin capitale 'principal sum of money, capital', itself derived in turn from latin caput 'head'. cattle originally meant movable personal property, especially livestock of any kind, as opposed to real property (the land, which also included wild or small free-roaming animals such as chickens—they were sold as part of the land).[11] the word is a variant of chattel (a unit of personal property) and closely related to capital in the economic sense.[12] the term replaced earlier old english feoh 'cattle, property', which survives today as fee (cf. german: vieh, dutch: vee, gothic: faihu). the word ""cow"" came via anglo-saxon cū (plural cȳ), from common indo-european gʷōus (genitive gʷowés) = ""a bovine animal"", compare persian: gâv, sanskrit: go-, welsh: buwch.[13] the plural cȳ became ki or kie in middle english, and an additional plural ending was often added, giving kine, kien, but also kies, kuin and others. this is the origin of the now archaic english plural, ""kine"". the scots language singular is coo or cou, and the plural is ""kye"". in older english sources such as the king james version of the bible, ""cattle"" refers to livestock, as opposed to ""deer"" which refers to wildlife. ""wild cattle"" may refer to feral cattle or to undomesticated species of the genus bos. today, when used without any other qualifier, the modern meaning of ""cattle"" is usually restricted to domesticated bovines.[14] in general, the same words are used in different parts of the world, but with minor differences in the definitions. the terminology described here contrasts the differences in definition between the united kingdom and other british-influenced parts of the world such as canada, australia, new zealand, ireland and the united states.[15] ""cattle"" can only be used in the plural and not in the singular: it is a plurale tantum.[26] thus one may refer to ""three cattle"" or ""some cattle"", but not ""one cattle"". ""one head of cattle"" is a valid though periphrastic way to refer to one animal of indeterminate or unknown age and sex; otherwise no universally used single-word singular form of cattle exists in modern english, other than the sex- and age-specific terms such as cow, bull, steer and heifer. historically, ""ox"" was not a sex-specific term for adult cattle, but generally this is now used only for working cattle, especially adult castrated males. the term is also incorporated into the names of other species, such as the musk ox and ""grunting ox"" (yak), and is used in some areas to describe certain cattle products such as ox-hide and oxtail.[27] cow is in general use as a singular for the collective cattle. the word cow is easy to use when a singular is needed and the sex is unknown or irrelevant—when ""there is a cow in the road"", for example. further, any herd of fully mature cattle in or near a pasture is statistically likely to consist mostly of cows, so the term is probably accurate even in the restrictive sense. other than the few bulls needed for breeding, the vast majority of male cattle are castrated as calves and are used as oxen or slaughtered for meat before the age of three years. thus, in a pastured herd, any calves or herd bulls usually are clearly distinguishable from the cows due to distinctively different sizes and clear anatomical differences. merriam-webster and oxford living dictionaries recognize the sex-nonspecific use of cow as an alternate definition,[28][29] whereas collins and the oed do not. colloquially, more general nonspecific terms may denote cattle when a singular form is needed. head of cattle is usually used only after a numeral. australian, new zealand and british farmers use the term beast or cattle beast. bovine is also used in britain. the term critter is common in the western united states and canada, particularly when referring to young cattle.[30] in some areas of the american south (particularly the appalachian region), where both dairy and beef cattle are present, an individual animal was once called a ""beef critter"", though that term is becoming archaic. cattle raised for human consumption are called beef cattle. within the beef cattle industry in parts of the united states, the term beef (plural beeves) is still used in its archaic sense to refer to an animal of either sex. cows of certain breeds that are kept for the milk they give are called dairy cows or milking cows (formerly milch cows). most young male offspring of dairy cows are sold for veal, and may be referred to as veal calves. the term dogies is used to describe orphaned calves in the context of ranch work in the american west, as in ""keep them dogies moving"".[31] in some places, a cow kept to provide milk for one family is called a ""house cow"". other obsolete terms for cattle include ""neat"" (this use survives in ""neatsfoot oil"", extracted from the feet and legs of cattle), and ""beefing"" (young animal fit for slaughter). an onomatopoeic term for one of the most common sounds made by cattle is moo (also called lowing). there are a number of other sounds made by cattle, including calves bawling, and bulls bellowing. bawling is most common for cows after weaning of a calf. the bullroarer makes a sound similar to a bull's territorial call.[32] cattle are large quadrupedal ungulate mammals with cloven hooves. most breeds have horns, which can be as large as the texas longhorn or small like a scur. careful genetic selection has allowed polled (hornless) cattle to become widespread. cattle are ruminants, meaning their digestive system is highly specialized to allow the use of poorly digestible plants as food. cattle have one stomach with four compartments, the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, with the rumen being the largest compartment. the reticulum, the smallest compartment, is known as the ""honeycomb"". the omasum's main function is to absorb water and nutrients from the digestible feed. the omasum is known as the ""many plies"". the abomasum is like the human stomach; this is why it is known as the ""true stomach"". cattle are known for regurgitating and re-chewing their food, known as cud chewing, like most ruminants. while the animal is feeding, the food is swallowed without being chewed and goes into the rumen for storage until the animal can find a quiet place to continue the digestion process. the food is regurgitated, a mouthful at a time, back up to the mouth, where the food, now called the cud, is chewed by the molars, grinding down the coarse vegetation to small particles. the cud is then swallowed again and further digested by specialized microorganisms in the rumen. these microbes are primarily responsible for decomposing cellulose and other carbohydrates into volatile fatty acids cattle use as their primary metabolic fuel. the microbes inside the rumen also synthesize amino acids from non-protein nitrogenous sources, such as urea and ammonia. as these microbes reproduce in the rumen, older generations die and their cells continue on through the digestive tract. these cells are then partially digested in the small intestines, allowing cattle to gain a high-quality protein source. these features allow cattle to thrive on grasses and other tough vegetation. the gestation period for a cow is about nine months long. a newborn calf's size can vary among breeds, but a typical calf weighs 25 to 45 kg (55 to 99 lb). adult size and weight vary significantly among breeds and sex. steers are generally killed before reaching 750 kg (1,650 lb). breeding stock may be allowed a longer lifespan, occasionally living as long as 25 years. the oldest recorded cow, big bertha, died at the age of 48 in 1993. on farms it is very common to use artificial insemination (ai), a medically assisted reproduction technique consisting of the artificial deposition of semen in the female's genital tract.[33] it is used in cases where the spermatozoa can not reach the fallopian tubes or simply by choice of the owner of the animal. it consists of transferring, to the uterine cavity, spermatozoa previously collected and processed, with the selection of morphologically more normal and mobile spermatozoa. a cow's udder contains two pairs of mammary glands, (commonly referred to as teats) creating four ""quarters"".[34] the front ones are referred to as fore quarters and the rear ones rear quarters.[35] synchronization of cattle ovulation to benefit dairy farming may be accomplished via induced ovulation techniques. bulls become fertile at about seven months of age. their fertility is closely related to the size of their testicles, and one simple test of fertility is to measure the circumference of the scrotum: a young bull is likely to be fertile once this reaches 28 centimetres (11 in); that of a fully adult bull may be over 40 centimetres (16 in).[36][37] a bull has a fibro-elastic penis. given the small amount of erectile tissue, there is little enlargement after erection. the penis is quite rigid when non-erect, and becomes even more rigid during erection. protrusion is not affected much by erection, but more by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure.[38][39][40] the weight of adult cattle varies, depending on the breed. smaller kinds, such as dexter and jersey adults, range between 272 to 454 kg (600 to 1,000 lb). large continental breeds, such as charolais, marchigiana, belgian blue and chianina adults range from 635 to 1,134 kg (1,400 to 2,500 lb). british breeds, such as hereford, angus, and shorthorn, mature at between 454 to 907 kg (1,000 to 2,000 lb), occasionally higher, particularly with angus and hereford.[41] bulls are larger than cows of the same breed by up to a few hundred kilograms. chianina bulls can weigh up to 1,500 kg (3,300 lb); british bulls, such as angus and hereford, can weigh as little as 907 kg (2,000 lb) to as much as 1,361 kg (3,000 lb).[citation needed] the world record for the heaviest bull was 1,740 kg (3,840 lb), a chianina named donetto, when he was exhibited at the arezzo show in 1955.[42] the heaviest steer was eight-year-old 'old ben', a shorthorn/​hereford cross weighing in at 2,140 kg (4,720 lb) in 1910.[43] in the united states, the average weight of beef cattle has steadily increased, especially since the 1970s, requiring the building of new slaughterhouses able to handle larger carcasses. new packing plants in the 1980s stimulated a large increase in cattle weights.[44] before 1790 beef cattle averaged only 160 kg (350 lb) net; and thereafter weights climbed steadily.[45][46] in laboratory studies, young cattle are able to memorize the locations of several food sources and retain this memory for at least 8 hours, although this declined after 12 hours.[47] fifteen-month-old heifers learn more quickly than adult cows which have had either one or two calvings, but their longer-term memory is less stable.[48] mature cattle perform well in spatial learning tasks and have a good long-term memory in these tests. cattle tested in a radial arm maze are able to remember the locations of high-quality food for at least 30 days. although they initially learn to avoid low-quality food, this memory diminishes over the same duration.[49] under less artificial testing conditions, young cattle showed they were able to remember the location of feed for at least 48 days.[50] cattle can make an association between a visual stimulus and food within 1 day—memory of this association can be retained for 1 year, despite a slight decay.[51] calves are capable of discrimination learning[52] and adult cattle compare favourably with small mammals in their learning ability in the closed-field test.[53] they are also able to discriminate between familiar individuals, and among humans. cattle can tell the difference between familiar and unfamiliar animals of the same species (conspecifics). studies show they behave less aggressively toward familiar individuals when they are forming a new group.[54] calves can also discriminate between humans based on previous experience, as shown by approaching those who handled them positively and avoiding those who handled them aversively.[55] although cattle can discriminate between humans by their faces alone, they also use other cues such as the color of clothes when these are available.[56] in audio play-back studies, calves prefer their own mother's vocalizations compared to the vocalizations of an unfamiliar mother.[57] in laboratory studies using images, cattle can discriminate between images of the heads of cattle and other animal species.[58] they are also able to distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics. furthermore, they are able to categorize images as familiar and unfamiliar individuals.[54] when mixed with other individuals, cloned calves from the same donor form subgroups, indicating that kin discrimination occurs and may be a basis of grouping behaviour. it has also been shown using images of cattle that both artificially inseminated and cloned calves have similar cognitive capacities of kin and non-kin discrimination.[59] cattle can recognize familiar individuals. visual individual recognition is a more complex mental process than visual discrimination. it requires the recollection of the learned idiosyncratic identity of an individual that has been previously encountered and the formation of a mental representation.[60] by using 2-dimensional images of the heads of one cow (face, profiles, ​3⁄4 views), all the tested heifers showed individual recognition of familiar and unfamiliar individuals from their own breed. furthermore, almost all the heifers recognized unknown individuals from different breeds, although this was achieved with greater difficulty. individual recognition was most difficult when the visual features of the breed being tested were quite different from the breed in the image, for example, the breed being tested had no spots whereas the image was of a spotted breed.[61] cattle use visual/brain lateralisation in their visual scanning of novel and familiar stimuli.[62] domestic cattle prefer to view novel stimuli with the left eye, i.e. using the right brain hemisphere (similar to horses, australian magpies, chicks, toads and fish) but use the right eye, i.e. using the left hemisphere, for viewing familiar stimuli.[63] in cattle, temperament can affect production traits such as carcass and meat quality or milk yield as well as affecting the animal's overall health and reproduction. cattle temperament is defined as ""the consistent behavioral and physiological difference observed between individuals in response to a stressor or environmental challenge and is used to describe the relatively stable difference in the behavioral predisposition of an animal, which can be related to psychobiological mechanisms"".[65] generally, cattle temperament is assumed to be multidimensional. five underlying categories of temperament traits have been proposed:[66] in a study on holstein–friesian heifers learning to press a panel to open a gate for access to a food reward, the researchers also recorded the heart rate and behavior of the heifers when moving along the race towards the food. when the heifers made clear improvements in learning, they had higher heart rates and tended to move more vigorously along the race. the researchers concluded this was an indication that cattle may react emotionally to their own learning improvement.[67] negative emotional states are associated with a bias toward negative responses towards ambiguous cues in judgement tasks. after separation from their mothers, holstein calves showed such a cognitive bias indicative of low mood.[68] a similar study showed that after hot-iron disbudding (dehorning), calves had a similar negative bias indicating that post-operative pain following this routine procedure results in a negative change in emotional state.[69] in studies of visual discrimination, the position of the ears has been used as an indicator of emotional state.[54] when cattle are stressed other cattle can tell by the chemicals released in their urine.[70] cattle are very gregarious and even short-term isolation is considered to cause severe psychological stress. when aubrac and friesian heifers are isolated, they increase their vocalizations and experience increased heart rate and plasma cortisol concentrations. these physiological changes are greater in aubracs. when visual contact is re-instated, vocalizations rapidly decline, regardless of the familiarity of the returning cattle, however, heart rate decreases are greater if the returning cattle are familiar to the previously-isolated individual.[71] mirrors have been used to reduce stress in isolated cattle.[72] cattle use all of the five widely recognized sensory modalities. these can assist in some complex behavioural patterns, for example, in grazing behaviour. cattle eat mixed diets, but when given the opportunity, show a partial preference of approximately 70% clover and 30% grass. this preference has a diurnal pattern, with a stronger preference for clover in the morning, and the proportion of grass increasing towards the evening.[73] vision is the dominant sense in cattle and they obtain almost 50% of their information visually. [74] cattle are a prey animal and to assist predator detection, their eyes are located on the sides of their head rather than the front. this gives them a wide field of view of 330° but limits binocular vision (and therefore stereopsis) to 30° to 50° compared to 140° in humans.[54][75] this means they have a blind spot directly behind them. cattle have good visual acuity,[54] but compared to humans, their visual accommodation is poor.[clarification needed][74] cattle have two kinds of color receptors in the cone cells of their retinas. this means that cattle are dichromatic, as are most other non-primate land mammals.[76][77] there are two to three rods per cone in the fovea centralis but five to six near the optic papilla.[75] cattle can distinguish long wavelength colors (yellow, orange and red) much better than the shorter wavelengths (blue, grey and green). calves are able to discriminate between long (red) and short (blue) or medium (green) wavelengths, but have limited ability to discriminate between the short and medium. they also approach handlers more quickly under red light.[78] whilst having good color sensitivity, it is not as good as humans or sheep.[54] a common misconception about cattle (particularly bulls) is that they are enraged by the color red (something provocative is often said to be ""like a red flag to a bull""). this is a myth. in bullfighting, it is the movement of the red flag or cape that irritates the bull and incites it to charge.[79] cattle have a well-developed sense of taste and can distinguish the four primary tastes (sweet, salty, bitter and sour). they possess around 20,000 taste buds. the strength of taste perception depends on the individual's current food requirements. they avoid bitter-tasting foods (potentially toxic) and have a marked preference for sweet (high calorific value) and salty foods (electrolyte balance). their sensitivity to sour-tasting foods helps them to maintain optimal ruminal ph.[74] plants have low levels of sodium and cattle have developed the capacity of seeking salt by taste and smell. if cattle become depleted of sodium salts, they show increased locomotion directed to searching for these. to assist in their search, the olfactory and gustatory receptors able to detect minute amounts of sodium salts increase their sensitivity as biochemical disruption develops with sodium salt depletion.[80][81] cattle hearing ranges from 23 hz to 35 khz. their frequency of best sensitivity is 8 khz and they have a lowest threshold of −21 db (re 20 μn/m−2), which means their hearing is more acute than horses (lowest threshold of 7 db).[82] sound localization acuity thresholds are an average of 30°. this means that cattle are less able to localise sounds compared to goats (18°), dogs (8°) and humans (0.8°).[83] because cattle have a broad foveal fields of view covering almost the entire horizon, they may not need very accurate locus information from their auditory systems to direct their gaze to a sound source. vocalizations are an important mode of communication amongst cattle and can provide information on the age, sex, dominance status and reproductive status of the caller. calves can recognize their mothers using vocalizations; vocal behaviour may play a role by indicating estrus and competitive display by bulls.[84] cattle have a range of odiferous glands over their body including interdigital, infraorbital, inguinal and sebaceous glands, indicating that olfaction probably plays a large role in their social life. both the primary olfactory system using the olfactory bulbs, and the secondary olfactory system using the vomeronasal organ are used.[85] this latter olfactory system is used in the flehmen response. there is evidence that when cattle are stressed, this can be recognised by other cattle and this is communicated by alarm substances in the urine.[70] the odour of dog faeces induces behavioural changes prior to cattle feeding, whereas the odours of urine from either stressed or non-stressed conspecifics and blood have no effect.[86] in the laboratory, cattle can be trained to recognise conspecific individuals using olfaction only.[85] in general, cattle use their sense of smell to ""expand"" on information detected by other sensory modalities. however, in the case of social and reproductive behaviours, olfaction is a key source of information.[74] cattle have tactile sensations detected mainly by mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors and nociceptors in the skin and muzzle. these are used most frequently when cattle explore their environment.[74] there is conflicting evidence for magnetoreception in cattle. one study reported that resting and grazing cattle tend to align their body axes in the geomagnetic north–south (n-s) direction.[87] in a follow-up study, cattle exposed to various magnetic fields directly beneath or in the vicinity of power lines trending in various magnetic directions exhibited distinct patterns of alignment.[88] however, in 2011, a group of czech researchers reported their failed attempt to replicate the finding using google earth images.[89] under natural conditions, calves stay with their mother until weaning at 8 to 11 months. heifer and bull calves are equally attached to their mothers in the first few months of life.[90] cattle are considered to be ""hider"" type animals,[clarification needed] but in the artificial environment of small calving pens, close proximity between cow and calf is maintained by the mother at the first three calvings but this changes to being mediated by the calf after these. primiparous dams show a higher incidence of abnormal maternal behavior.[91] beef-calves reared on the range suckle an average of 5.0 times every 24 hours with an average total time of 46 min spent suckling. there is a diurnal rhythm in suckling activity with peaks between 05:00–07:00, 10:00–13:00 and 17:00–21:00.[92] studies on the natural weaning of zebu cattle (bos indicus) have shown that the cow weans her calves over a 2-week period, but after that, she continues to show strong affiliatory behavior with her offspring and preferentially chooses them for grooming and as grazing partners for at least 4–5 years.[93] semi-wild highland cattle heifers first give birth at 2 or 3 years of age, and the timing of birth is synchronized with increases in natural food quality. average calving interval is 391 days, and calving mortality within the first year of life is 5%.[94] one study showed that over a 4-year period, dominance relationships within a herd of semi-wild highland cattle were very firm. there were few overt aggressive conflicts and the majority of disputes were settled by agonistic (non-aggressive, competitive) behaviors that involved no physical contact between opponents (e.g. threatening and spontaneous withdrawing). such agonistic behavior reduces the risk of injury. dominance status depended on age and sex, with older animals generally being dominant to young ones and males dominant to females. young bulls gained superior dominance status over adult cows when they reached about 2 years of age.[94] as with many animal dominance hierarchies, dominance-associated aggressiveness does not correlate with rank position, but is closely related to rank distance between individuals.[94] dominance is maintained in several ways. cattle often engage in mock fights where they test each other's strength in a non-aggressive way. licking is primarily performed by subordinates and received by dominant animals. mounting is a playful behavior shown by calves of both sexes and by bulls and sometimes by cows in estrus,[95] however, this is not a dominance related behavior as has been found in other species.[94] the horns of cattle are ""honest signals"" used in mate selection. furthermore, horned cattle attempt to keep greater distances between themselves and have fewer physical interactions than hornless cattle. this leads to more stable social relationships.[96] in calves, the frequency of agonistic behavior decreases as space allowance increases, but this does not occur for changes in group size. however, in adult cattle, the number of agonistic encounters increases as the group size increases.[97] when grazing, cattle vary several aspects of their bite, i.e. tongue and jaw movements, depending on characteristics of the plant they are eating. bite area decreases with the density of the plants but increases with their height. bite area is determined by the sweep of the tongue; in one study observing 750-kilogram (1,650 lb) steers, bite area reached a maximum of approximately 170 cm2 (30 sq in). bite depth increases with the height of the plants. by adjusting their behavior, cattle obtain heavier bites in swards that are tall and sparse compared with short, dense swards of equal mass/area.[98] cattle adjust other aspects of their grazing behavior in relation to the available food; foraging velocity decreases and intake rate increases in areas of abundant palatable forage.[99] cattle avoid grazing areas contaminated by the faeces of other cattle more strongly than they avoid areas contaminated by sheep,[100] but they do not avoid pasture contaminated by rabbit faeces.[101] on 24 april 2009, edition of the journal science, a team of researchers led by the national institutes of health and the us department of agriculture reported having mapped the bovine genome.[102] the scientists found cattle have about 22,000 genes, and 80% of their genes are shared with humans, and they share about 1000 genes with dogs and rodents, but are not found in humans. using this bovine ""hapmap"", researchers can track the differences between the breeds that affect the quality of meat and milk yields.[103] behavioral traits of cattle can be as heritable as some production traits, and often, the two can be related.[104] the heritability of fear varies markedly in cattle from low (0.1) to high (0.53); such high variation is also found in pigs and sheep, probably due to differences in the methods used.[105] the heritability of temperament (response to isolation during handling) has been calculated as 0.36 and 0.46 for habituation to handling.[106] rangeland assessments show that the heritability of aggressiveness in cattle is around 0.36.[107] quantitative trait loci (qtls) have been found for a range of production and behavioral characteristics for both dairy and beef cattle.[108] cattle occupy a unique role in human history, having been domesticated since at least the early neolithic age. archeozoological and genetic data indicate that cattle were first domesticated from wild aurochs (bos primigenius) approximately 10,500 years ago. there were two major areas of domestication: one in the near east (specifically central anatolia, the levant and western iran), giving rise to the taurine line, and a second in the area that is now pakistan, resulting in the indicine line.[109] modern mitochondrial dna variation indicates the taurine line may have arisen from as few as 80 aurochs tamed in the upper reaches of mesopotamia near the villages of çayönü tepesi in what is now southeastern turkey and dja'de el-mughara in what is now northern iraq.[1] although european cattle are largely descended from the taurine lineage, gene flow from african cattle (partially of indicine origin) contributed substantial genomic components to both southern european cattle breeds and their new world descendants.[109] a study on 134 breeds showed that modern taurine cattle originated from africa, asia, north and south america, australia, and europe.[110] some researchers have suggested that african taurine cattle are derived from a third independent domestication from north african aurochsen.[109] as early as 9000 bc both grain and cattle were used as money or as barter (the first grain remains found, considered to be evidence of pre-agricultural practice date to 17,000 bc).[111][112][113] some evidence also exists to suggest that other animals, such as camels and goats, may have been used as currency in some parts of the world.[114] one of the advantages of using cattle as currency is that it allows the seller to set a fixed price. it even created the standard pricing. for example, two chickens were traded for one cow as cows were deemed to be more valuable than chickens.[112] cattle are often raised by allowing herds to graze on the grasses of large tracts of rangeland. raising cattle in this manner allows the use of land that might be unsuitable for growing crops. the most common interactions with cattle involve daily feeding, cleaning and milking. many routine husbandry practices involve ear tagging, dehorning, loading, medical operations, vaccinations and hoof care, as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations. also, some cultural differences occur in working with cattle; the cattle husbandry of fulani men rests on behavioural techniques, whereas in europe, cattle are controlled primarily by physical means, such as fences.[115] breeders use cattle husbandry to reduce m. bovis infection susceptibility by selective breeding and maintaining herd health to avoid concurrent disease.[116] cattle are farmed for beef, veal, dairy, and leather. they are less commonly used for conservation grazing, or simply to maintain grassland for wildlife, such as in epping forest, england. they are often used in some of the most wild places for livestock. depending on the breed, cattle can survive on hill grazing, heaths, marshes, moors and semidesert. modern cattle are more commercial than older breeds and, having become more specialized, are less versatile. for this reason, many smaller farmers still favor old breeds, such as the jersey dairy breed. in portugal, spain, southern france and some latin american countries, bulls are used in the activity of bullfighting; jallikattu in india is a bull taming sport radically different from european bullfighting, humans are unarmed and bulls are not killed. in many other countries bullfighting is illegal. other activities such as bull riding are seen as part of a rodeo, especially in north america. bull-leaping, a central ritual in bronze age minoan culture (see sacred bull), still exists in southwestern france. in modern times, cattle are also entered into agricultural competitions. these competitions can involve live cattle or cattle carcases in hoof and hook events. in terms of food intake by humans, consumption of cattle is less efficient than of grain or vegetables with regard to land use, and hence cattle grazing consumes more area than such other agricultural production when raised on grains.[117] nonetheless, cattle and other forms of domesticated animals can sometimes help to use plant resources in areas not easily amenable to other forms of agriculture. bulls are sometimes used as guard animals.[118][119] the average sleep time of a domestic cow is about 4 hours a day.[120] cattle do have a stay apparatus,[121] but do not sleep standing up,[122] they lie down to sleep deeply.[123] in spite of the urban legend, cows cannot be tipped over by people pushing on them.[124] the meat of adult cattle is known as beef, and that of calves is veal. other animal parts are also used as food products, including blood, liver, kidney, heart and oxtail. cattle also produce milk, and dairy cattle are specifically bred to produce the large quantities of milk processed and sold for human consumption. cattle today are the basis of a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. the international trade in beef for 2000 was over $30 billion and represented only 23% of world beef production.[125] approximately 300 million cattle, including dairy cattle, are slaughtered each year for food.[126] the production of milk, which is also made into cheese, butter, yogurt, and other dairy products, is comparable in economic size to beef production, and provides an important part of the food supply for many of the world's people. cattle hides, used for leather to make shoes, couches and clothing, are another widespread product. cattle remain broadly used as draft animals in many developing countries, such as india. cattle are also used in some sporting games, including rodeo and bullfighting. source: helgi library,[127] world bank, faostat about half the world's meat comes from cattle.[128] certain breeds of cattle, such as the holstein-friesian, are used to produce milk,[129][130] which can be processed into dairy products such as milk, cheese or yogurt. dairy cattle are usually kept on specialized dairy farms designed for milk production. most cows are milked twice per day, with milk processed at a dairy, which may be onsite at the farm or the milk may be shipped to a dairy plant for eventual sale of a dairy product.[131] for dairy cattle to continue producing milk, they must give birth to one calf per year. if the calf is male, it generally is slaughtered at a young age to produce veal.[132] they will continue to produce milk until three weeks before birth.[130] over the last fifty years, dairy farming has become more intensive to increase the yield of milk produced by each cow. the holstein-friesian is the breed of dairy cow most common in the uk, europe and the united states. it has been bred selectively to produce the highest yields of milk of any cow. around 22 litres per day is average in the uk.[129][130] most cattle are not kept solely for hides, which are usually a by-product of beef production. hides are most commonly used for leather, which can be made into a variety of product, including shoes. in 2012 india was the world's largest producer of cattle hides.[133] feral cattle are defined as being 'cattle that are not domesticated or cultivated'.[134] populations of feral cattle are known to come from and exist in: australia, united states of america,[135] colombia, argentina, spain, france and many islands, including new guinea, hawaii, galapagos, juan fernández islands, hispaniola (dominican republic and haiti), tristan da cunha and île amsterdam,[136] two islands of kuchinoshima[137] and kazura island next to naru island in japan.[138][139] chillingham cattle is sometimes regarded as a feral breed.[140] aleutian wild cattles can be found on aleutian islands.[141] the ""kinmen cattle"" which is dominantly found on kinmen island, taiwan is mostly domesticated while smaller portion of the population is believed to live in the wild due to accidental releases.[142] other notable examples include cattle in the vicinity of hong kong (in the shing mun country park,[143] among sai kung district[144] and lantau island[145] and on grass island[146]), and semi-feral animals in yangmingshan, taiwan.[147] (2003) & hoekstra (2003) (2003) gut flora in cattle include methanogens that produce methane as a byproduct of enteric fermentation, which cattle belch out. the same volume of atmospheric methane has a higher global warming potential than atmospheric carbon dioxide.[151][152] methane belching from cattle can be reduced with genetic selection, immunization, rumen defaunation, diet modification, decreased antibiotic use, and grazing management, among others.[153][154][155][156] a report from the food and agriculture organization (fao) states that the livestock sector is ""responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions"".[157] the ipcc estimates that cattle and other livestock emit about 80 to 93 megatonnes of methane per year,[158] accounting for an estimated 37% of anthropogenic methane emissions,[157] and additional methane is produced by anaerobic fermentation of manure in manure lagoons and other manure storage structures.[159] the net change in atmospheric methane content was recently about 1 megatonne per year,[160] and in some recent years there has been no increase in atmospheric methane content.[161] while cattle fed forage actually produce more methane than grain-fed cattle, the increase may be offset by the increased carbon recapture of pastures, which recapture three times the co2 of cropland used for grain.[162] one of the cited changes suggested to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is intensification of the livestock industry, since intensification leads to less land for a given level of production. this assertion is supported by studies of the us beef production system, suggesting practices prevailing in 2007 involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16.3% less greenhouse gas emissions, 12.1% less water use, and 33.0% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than those used in 1977.[163] the analysis took into account not only practices in feedlots, but also feed production (with less feed needed in more intensive production systems), forage-based cow-calf operations and back-grounding before cattle enter a feedlot (with more beef produced per head of cattle from those sources, in more intensive systems), and beef from animals derived from the dairy industry. the number of american cattle kept in confined feedlot conditions fluctuates. from 1 january 2002 through 1 january 2012, there was no significant overall upward or downward trend in the number of us cattle on feed for slaughter, which averaged about 14.046 million head over that period.[164][165] previously, the number had increased; it was 12.453 million in 1985.[166] cattle on feed (for slaughter) numbered about 14.121 million on 1 january 2012, i.e. about 15.5% of the estimated inventory of 90.8 million us cattle (including calves) on that date. of the 14.121 million, us cattle on feed (for slaughter) in operations with 1000 head or more were estimated to number 11.9 million.[165] cattle feedlots in this size category correspond to the regulatory definition of ""large"" concentrated animal feeding operations (cafos) for cattle other than mature dairy cows or veal calves.[167] significant numbers of dairy, as well as beef cattle, are confined in cafos, defined as ""new and existing operations which stable or confine and feed or maintain for a total of 45 days or more in any 12-month period more than the number of animals specified""[168] where ""[c]rops, vegetation, forage growth, or post-harvest residues are not sustained in the normal growing season over any portion of the lot or facility.""[169] they may be designated as small, medium and large. such designation of cattle cafos is according to cattle type (mature dairy cows, veal calves or other) and cattle numbers, but medium cafos are so designated only if they meet certain discharge criteria, and small cafos are designated only on a case-by-case basis.[170] a cafo that discharges pollutants is required to obtain a permit, which requires a plan to manage nutrient runoff, manure, chemicals, contaminants, and other wastewater pursuant to the us clean water act.[171] the regulations involving cafo permitting have been extensively litigated.[172] commonly, cafo wastewater and manure nutrients are applied to land at agronomic rates for use by forages or crops, and it is often assumed that various constituents of wastewater and manure, e.g. organic contaminants and pathogens, will be retained, inactivated or degraded on the land with application at such rates; however, additional evidence is needed to test reliability of such assumptions .[173] concerns raised by opponents of cafos have included risks of contaminated water due to feedlot runoff,[174] soil erosion, human and animal exposure to toxic chemicals, development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and an increase in e. coli contamination.[175] while research suggests some of these impacts can be mitigated by developing wastewater treatment systems[174] and planting cover crops in larger setback zones,[176] the union of concerned scientists released a report in 2008 concluding that cafos are generally unsustainable and externalize costs.[162] an estimated 935,000 cattle operations were operating in the us in 2010.[177] in 2001, the us environmental protection agency (epa) tallied 5,990 cattle cafos then regulated, consisting of beef (2,200), dairy (3,150), heifer (620) and veal operations (20).[178] since that time, the epa has established cafos as an enforcement priority. epa enforcement highlights for fiscal year 2010 indicated enforcement actions against 12 cattle cafos for violations that included failures to obtain a permit, failures to meet the terms of a permit, and discharges of contaminated water.[179] another concern is manure, which if not well-managed, can lead to adverse environmental consequences. however, manure also is a valuable source of nutrients and organic matter when used as a fertilizer.[180] manure was used as a fertilizer on about 6,400,000 hectares (15.8 million acres) of us cropland in 2006, with manure from cattle accounting for nearly 70% of manure applications to soybeans and about 80% or more of manure applications to corn, wheat, barley, oats and sorghum.[181] substitution of manure for synthetic fertilizers in crop production can be environmentally significant, as between 43 and 88 megajoules of fossil fuel energy would be used per kg of nitrogen in manufacture of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.[182] grazing by cattle at low intensities can create a favourable environment for native herbs and forbs by mimicking the native grazers who they displaced; in many world regions, though, cattle are reducing biodiversity due to overgrazing.[183] a survey of refuge managers on 123 national wildlife refuges in the us tallied 86 species of wildlife considered positively affected and 82 considered negatively affected by refuge cattle grazing or haying.[184] proper management of pastures, notably managed intensive rotational grazing and grazing at low intensities can lead to less use of fossil fuel energy, increased recapture of carbon dioxide, fewer ammonia emissions into the atmosphere, reduced soil erosion, better air quality, and less water pollution.[162] the veterinary discipline dealing with cattle and cattle diseases (bovine veterinary) is called buiatrics.[185] veterinarians and professionals working on cattle health issues are pooled in the world association for buiatrics, founded in 1960.[186] national associations and affiliates also exist.[187] cattle diseases were in the center of attention in the 1980s and 1990s when the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse), also known as mad cow disease, was of concern. cattle might catch and develop various other diseases, like blackleg, bluetongue, foot rot too.[188][189][190] in most states, as cattle health is not only a veterinarian issue, but also a public health issue, public health and food safety standards and farming regulations directly affect the daily work of farmers who keep cattle.[191] however, said rules change frequently and are often debated. for instance, in the u.k., it was proposed in 2011 that milk from tuberculosis-infected cattle should be allowed to enter the food chain.[192] internal food safety regulations might affect a country's trade policy as well. for example, the united states has just reviewed its beef import rules according to the ""mad cow standards""; while mexico forbids the entry of cattle who are older than 30 months.[193] cow urine is commonly used in india for internal medical purposes.[194][195] it is distilled and then consumed by patients seeking treatment for a wide variety of illnesses.[196] at present, no conclusive medical evidence shows this has any effect.[197] however, an indian medicine containing cow urine has already obtained u.s. patents.[198] digital dermatitis is caused by the bacteria from the genus treponema. it differs from foot rot and can appear under unsanitary conditions such as poor hygiene or inadequate hoof trimming, among other causes. it primarily affects dairy cattle and has been known to lower the quantity of milk produced, however the milk quality remains unaffected. cattle are also susceptible to ringworm caused by the fungus, trichophyton verrucosum, a contagious skin disease which may be transferred to humans exposed to infected cows.[199] stocking density refers to the number of animals within a specified area. when stocking density reaches high levels, the behavioural needs of the animals may not be met. this can negatively influence health, welfare and production performance.[200] the effect of overstocking in cows can have a negative effect on milk production and reproduction rates which are two very important traits for dairy farmers. overcrowding of cows in barns has been found to reduced feeding, resting and rumination.[200] although they consume the same amount of dry matter within the span of a day, they consume the food at a much more rapid rate, and this behaviour in cows can lead to further complications.[201] the feeding behaviour of cows during their post-milking period is very important as it has been proven that the longer animals can eat after milking, the longer they will be standing up and therefore causing less contamination to the teat ends.[202] this is necessary to reduce the risk of mastitis as infection has been shown to increase the chances of embryonic loss.[203] sufficient rest is important for dairy cows because it is during this period that their resting blood flow increases up to 50%, this is directly proportionate to milk production.[202] each additional hour of rest can be seen to translate to 2 to 3.5 more pounds of milk per cow daily. stocking densities of anything over 120% have been shown to decrease the amount of time cows spend lying down.[204] cortisol is an important stress hormone; its plasma concentrations increase greatly when subjected to high levels of stress.[205] increased concentration levels of cortisol have been associated with significant increases in gonadotrophin levels and lowered progestin levels. reduction of stress is important in the reproductive state of cows as an increase in gonadotrophin and lowered progesterone levels may impinge on the ovulatory and lutenization process and to reduce the chances of successful implantation.[206] a high cortisol level will also stimulate the degradation of fats and proteins which may make it difficult for the animal to sustain its pregnancy if implanted successfully.[205] animal rights activists have criticized the treatment of cattle, claiming that common practices in cattle husbandry, slaughter and entertainment unnecessarily cause fear, stress, and pain. they advocate for abstaining from the consumption of cattle-related animal products and cattle-based entertainment. the following husbandry practices have been criticized by animal welfare and animal rights groups:[207] branding,[208] castration,[209] dehorning,[210] ear tagging,[211] nose ringing,[212] restraint,[213] tail docking,[214] the use of veal crates,[215] and cattle prods.[216] there are concerns that the stress and negative health impacts induced by high stocking density such as in concentrated animal feeding operations or feedlots, auctions, and during transport may be detrimental to their welfare,[217][218] and has also been criticized.[219] the treatment of dairy cows faces additional criticism. to produce milk from dairy cattle, most calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and fed milk replacement in order to retain the cows' milk for human consumption.[220] animal welfare advocates are critical of this practice, stating that this breaks the natural bond between the mother and her calf.[220] the welfare of veal calves is also a concern.[220] in order to continue lactation, dairy cows are bred every year, usually through artificial insemination.[220] because of this, some individuals have posited that dairy production is based on the sexual exploitation of cows.[221] although the natural life expectancy of cattle could be as much as twenty years,[222] after about five years, a cow's milk production has dropped; at which point most dairy cows are sent to slaughter.[223][224] while leather is often a by-product of slaughter, in some countries, such as india and bangladesh, cows are raised primarily for their leather. these leather industries often make their cows walk long distances across borders to be killed in neighboring provinces and countries where cattle slaughter is legal. some cows die along the long journey, and sometimes exhausted animals are abused to keep them moving.[225] these practices have faced backlash from various animal rights groups.[226] animal treatment in rodeo is targeted most often at bull riding but also calf roping and steer roping, with the opposition saying that rodeos are unnecessary and cause stress, injury, and death to the animals.[227] in spain, the running of the bulls faces opposition due to the stress and injuries incurred by the bulls during the event.[228][229] bullfighting is opposed as a blood sport in which bulls are forced to suffer severe stress and death.[230] oxen (singular ox) are cattle trained as draft animals. often they are adult, castrated males of larger breeds, although females and bulls are also used in some areas. usually, an ox is over four years old due to the need for training and to allow it to grow to full size. oxen are used for plowing, transport, hauling cargo, grain-grinding by trampling or by powering machines, irrigation by powering pumps, and wagon drawing. oxen were commonly used to skid logs in forests, and sometimes still are, in low-impact, select-cut logging. oxen are most often used in teams of two, paired, for light work such as carting, with additional pairs added when more power is required, sometimes up to a total of 20 or more. oxen can be trained to respond to a teamster's signals. these signals are given by verbal commands or by noise (whip cracks). verbal commands vary according to dialect and local tradition. oxen can pull harder and longer than horses. though not as fast as horses, they are less prone to injury because they are more sure-footed. many oxen are used worldwide, especially in developing countries. about 11.3 million draft oxen are used in sub-saharan africa.[231] in india, the number of draft cattle in 1998 was estimated at 65.7 million head.[232] about half the world's crop production is thought to depend on land preparation (such as plowing) made possible by animal traction.[233] the cow is mentioned often in the quran. the second and longest surah of the quran is named al-baqara (""the cow""). out of the 286 verses of the surah, seven mention cows (al baqarah 67–73).[234][235] the name of the surah derives from this passage in which moses orders his people to sacrifice a cow in order to resurrect a man murdered by an unknown person.[236] cattle are venerated within the hindu religion of india. in the vedic period they were a symbol of plenty [237]:130 and were frequently slaughtered. in later times they gradually acquired their present status. according to the mahabharata, they are to be treated with the same respect 'as one's mother'.[238] in the middle of the first millennium, the consumption of beef began to be disfavoured by lawgivers.[237]:144 although there has never been any cow-goddesses or temples dedicated to them,[237]:146 cows appear in numerous stories from the vedas and puranas. the deity krishna was brought up in a family of cowherders, and given the name govinda (protector of the cows). also, shiva is traditionally said to ride on the back of a bull named nandi. milk and milk products were used in vedic rituals.[237]:130 in the postvedic period products of the cow—milk, curd, ghee, but also cow dung and urine (gomutra), or the combination of these five (panchagavya)—began to assume an increasingly important role in ritual purification and expiation.[237]:130–131 veneration of the cow has become a symbol of the identity of hindus as a community,[237]:20 especially since the end of the 19th century. slaughter of cows (including oxen, bulls and calves) is forbidden by law in several states of the indian union. mcdonald's outlets in india do not serve any beef burgers. in maharaja ranjit singh's empire of the early 19th century, the killing of a cow was punishable by death.[239] cattle are typically represented in heraldry by the bull. arms of the azores arms of mecklenburg region, germany arms of turin, italy arms of kaunas, lithuania arms of bielsk podlaski, poland arms of ciołek, poland arms of turek, poland for 2013, the fao estimated global cattle numbers at 1.47 billion.[243] regionally, the fao estimate for 2013 includes: asia 497 million; south america 350 million; africa 307 million; europe 122 million; north america 102 million; central america 47 million; oceania 40 million; and caribbean 9 million. didactic model of bovine bovine anatomical model

elephant," elephants are mammals of the family elephantidae and the largest existing land animals. three species are currently recognised: the african bush elephant, the african forest elephant, and the asian elephant. elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons. the family elephantidae also contains several now-extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. african elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. the trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. the large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. the pillar-like legs carry their great weight. elephants are scattered throughout sub-saharan africa, south asia, and southeast asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. they are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible. they are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. elephants have a fission–fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. the groups, which do not include bulls, are led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the matriarch. males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. they enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as reproductive success. calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. they communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. they appear to have self-awareness, and appear to show empathy for dying and dead family members. african elephants are listed as vulnerable and asian elephants as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn). one of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. elephants are used as working animals in asia. in the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture. the word ""elephant"" is based on the latin elephas (genitive elephantis) (""elephant""), which is the latinised form of the greek ἐλέφας (elephas) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephantos[1]), probably from a non-indo-european language, likely phoenician.[2] it is attested in mycenaean greek as e-re-pa (genitive e-re-pa-to) in linear b syllabic script.[3][4] as in mycenaean greek, homer used the greek word to mean ivory, but after the time of herodotus, it also referred to the animal.[1] the word ""elephant"" appears in middle english as olyfaunt (c.1300) and was borrowed from old french oliphant (12th century).[2] orycteropodidae macroscelididae chrysochloridae tenrecidae procaviidae elephantidae dugongidae trichechidae early proboscideans, e.g. moeritherium deinotheriidae mammutidae gomphotheriidae stegodontidae loxodonta mammuthus elephas mammuthus primigenius mammuthus columbi elephas maximus loxodonta cyclotis palaeoloxodon antiquus loxodonta africana mammut americanum elephants belong to the family elephantidae, the sole remaining family within the order proboscidea which belongs to the superorder afrotheria. their closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the clade paenungulata within the superorder afrotheria.[8] elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade tethytheria.[9] three species of elephants are recognised; the african bush elephant (loxodonta africana) and forest elephant (loxodonta cyclotis) of sub-saharan africa, and the asian elephant (elephas maximus) of south and southeast asia.[10] african elephants have larger ears, a concave back, more wrinkled skin, a sloping abdomen, and two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk. asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or level back, smoother skin, a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension at the tip of the trunk. the looped ridges on the molars are narrower in the asian elephant while those of the african are more diamond-shaped. the asian elephant also has dorsal bumps on its head and some patches of depigmentation on its skin.[11] among african elephants, forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants and are limited in range to the forested areas of western and central africa.[12] both kinds of elephant were traditionally considered to be the same species loxodonta africana, but molecular studies have affirmed their status as separate species.[13][14][15] in 2017, dna sequence analysis showed that l. cyclotis is more closely related to the extinct palaeoloxodon antiquus, than it is to l. africana, possibly undermining the genus loxodonta as a whole.[16] over 180 extinct members and three major evolutionary radiations of the order proboscidea have been recorded.[17] the earliest proboscids, the african eritherium and phosphatherium of the late paleocene, heralded the first radiation.[18] the eocene included numidotherium, moeritherium, and barytherium from africa. these animals were relatively small and aquatic. later on, genera such as phiomia and palaeomastodon arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. proboscidean diversity declined during the oligocene.[19] one notable species of this epoch was eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the horn of africa, which may have been an ancestor to several later species.[20] the beginning of the miocene saw the second diversification, with the appearance of the deinotheres and the mammutids. the former were related to barytherium and lived in africa and eurasia,[21] while the latter may have descended from eritreum[20] and spread to north america.[21] the second radiation was represented by the emergence of the gomphotheres in the miocene,[21] which likely evolved from eritreum[20] and originated in africa, spreading to every continent except australia and antarctica. members of this group included gomphotherium and platybelodon.[21] the third radiation started in the late miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids, which descended from, and slowly replaced, the gomphotheres.[22] the african primelephas gomphotheroides gave rise to loxodonta, mammuthus, and elephas. loxodonta branched off earliest around the miocene and pliocene boundary while mammuthus and elephas diverged later during the early pliocene. loxodonta remained in africa while mammuthus and elephas spread to eurasia, and the former reached north america. at the same time, the stegodontids, another proboscidean group descended from gomphotheres, spread throughout asia, including the indian subcontinent, china, southeast asia, and japan. mammutids continued to evolve into new species, such as the american mastodon.[23] at the beginning of the pleistocene, elephantids experienced a high rate of speciation.[24] the pleistocene also saw the arrival of palaeoloxodon namadicus, the largest terrestrial mammal of all time.[25] loxodonta atlantica became the most common species in northern and southern africa but was replaced by elephas iolensis later in the pleistocene. only when elephas disappeared from africa did loxodonta become dominant once again, this time in the form of the modern species. elephas diversified into new species in asia, such as e. hysudricus and e. platycephus;[26] the latter the likely ancestor of the modern asian elephant.[24] mammuthus evolved into several species, including the well-known woolly mammoth.[26] interbreeding appears to have been common among elephantid species, which in some cases led to species with three ancestral genetic components, such as the palaeoloxodon antiquus.[7] in the late pleistocene, most proboscidean species vanished during the quaternary glaciation which killed off 50% of genera weighing over 5 kg (11 lb) worldwide.[27] proboscideans experienced several evolutionary trends, such as an increase in size, which led to many giant species that stood up to 500 cm (16 ft 5 in) tall.[25] as with other megaherbivores, including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs, the large size of elephants likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value.[28] their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader.[6] the feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support.[29] early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's centre of gravity. the skull grew larger, especially the cranium, while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull. the increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach. the number of premolars, incisors and canines decreased.[6] the cheek teeth (molars and premolars) became larger and more specialized, especially after elephants started to switch from c3-plants to c4-grasses, which caused their teeth to undergo a three-fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago. only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of c3 trees and shrubs.[30][31] the upper second incisors grew into tusks, which varied in shape from straight, to curved (either upward or downward), to spiralled, depending on the species. some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors.[6] elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry, such as their middle ear anatomy.[32] several species of proboscideans lived on islands and experienced insular dwarfism. this occurred primarily during the pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants did exist earlier in the pliocene. these elephants likely grew smaller on islands due to a lack of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. by contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop gigantism in these conditions. dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in indonesia, the channel islands of california, and several islands of the mediterranean.[33] elephas celebensis of sulawesi is believed to have descended from elephas planifrons. palaeoloxodon falconeri of malta and sicily was only 100 cm (3 ft 3 in) and had probably evolved from the straight-tusked elephant. other descendants of the straight-tusked elephant existed in cyprus. dwarf elephants of uncertain descent lived in crete, cyclades, and dodecanese while dwarf mammoths are known to have lived in sardinia.[33] the columbian mammoth colonised the channel islands and evolved into the pygmy mammoth. this species reached a height of 120–180 cm (3 ft 11 in–5 ft 11 in) and weighed 200–2,000 kg (400–4,400 lb). a population of small woolly mammoths survived on wrangel island, now 140 km (87 mi) north of the siberian coast, as recently as 4,000 years ago.[33] after their discovery in 1993, they were considered dwarf mammoths.[34] this classification has been re-evaluated and since the second international mammoth conference in 1999, these animals are no longer considered to be true ""dwarf mammoths"".[35] elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. african bush elephants are the largest species, with males being 304–336 cm (10 ft 0 in–11 ft 0 in) tall at the shoulder with a body mass of 5.2–6.9 t (5.7–7.6 short tons) and females standing 247–273 cm (8 ft 1 in–8 ft 11 in) tall at the shoulder with a body mass of 2.6–3.5 t (2.9–3.9 short tons). male asian elephants are usually about 261–289 cm (8 ft 7 in–9 ft 6 in) tall at the shoulder and 3.5–4.6 t (3.9–5.1 short tons) whereas females are 228–252 cm (7 ft 6 in–8 ft 3 in) tall at the shoulder and 2.3–3.1 t (2.5–3.4 short tons). african forest elephants are the smallest species, with males usually being around 209–231 cm (6 ft 10 in–7 ft 7 in) tall at the shoulder and 1.7–2.3 t (1.9–2.5 short tons). male african bush elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females.[25] the skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones.[36] the vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. african elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.[37] an elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. the back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction.[38] the skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. these cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. the cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. the lower jaw is solid and heavy.[36] because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support.[6] lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. a durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. the animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes.[39] elephants are considered dichromats[40] and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light.[41] elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. the ear flaps, or pinnae, contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries. warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. this occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. of all the elephants, african bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps.[42] elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 khz (in close proximity to the soprano c).[43] the trunk, or proboscis, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early fetal life, the upper lip and trunk are separated.[6] the trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile appendage. it contains up to 150,000 separate muscle fascicles, with no bone and little fat. these paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. the former are divided into dorsals, ventrals, and laterals while the latter are divided into transverse and radiating muscles. the muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. the nasal septum is composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils. cartilage divides the nostrils at the base.[44] as a muscular hydrostat, the trunk moves by precisely coordinated muscle contractions. the muscles work both with and against each other. a unique proboscis nerve – formed by the maxillary and facial nerves – runs along both sides of the trunk.[45] elephant trunks have multiple functions, including breathing, olfaction, touching, grasping, and sound production.[6] the animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a bloodhound.[46] the trunk's ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food, wrestle with other elephants,[47] and lift up to 350 kg (770 lb).[6] it can be used for delicate tasks, such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice,[47] and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed.[6] with its trunk, an elephant can reach items at heights of up to 7 m (23 ft) and dig for water under mud or sand.[47] individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunks: some prefer to twist them to the left, others to the right.[45] elephants can suck up water both to drink and to spray on their bodies.[6] an adult asian elephant is capable of holding 8.5 l (2.2 us gal) of water in its trunk.[44] they will also spray dust or grass on themselves.[6] when underwater, the elephant uses its trunk as a snorkel.[32] the african elephant has two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. the asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth.[11] asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks.[44] losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival,[6] although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. one elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips.[44] floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in african bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.[48] elephants usually have 26 teeth: the incisors, known as the tusks, 12 deciduous premolars, and 12 molars. unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. the chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. the first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. the second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. the third set falls out at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. the fifth set of teeth falls out at the early 40s. the sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in african elephants.[49] the tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. they replace deciduous milk teeth at 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about 17 cm (7 in) a year. a newly developed tusk has a smooth enamel cap that eventually wears off. the dentine is known as ivory and its cross-section consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as ""engine turning"", which create diamond-shaped areas. as a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral calcite. much of the tusk can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. at least one-third of the tusk contains the pulp and some have nerves stretching to the tip. thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. when removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. tusks serve multiple purposes. they are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. when fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.[50] like humans, who are typically right- or left-handed, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. the dominant tusk, called the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. for the african elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to 300 cm (9 ft 10 in),[50] but those of males tend to be thicker.[51] in earlier times, elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90 kg) were not uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over 100 pounds (45 kg).[52] in the asian species, only the males have large tusks. female asians have very small tusks, or none at all.[50] tuskless males exist and are particularly common among sri lankan elephants.[53] asian males can have tusks as long as africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest recorded was 302 cm (9 ft 11 in) long and weighed 39 kg (86 lb). hunting for elephant ivory in africa[54] and asia[55] has led to natural selection for shorter tusks[56][57] and tusklessness.[58][59] an elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5 cm (1 in) thick on the back and parts of the head. the skin around the mouth, anus, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. elephants typically have grey skin, but african elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. as elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, genitals and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. normally the skin of an asian elephant is covered with more hair than its african counterpart.[60] an elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from ultraviolet light. although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. without regular mud baths to protect it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. after bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. they have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.[60] to support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals. the long bones of the limbs have cancellous bone in place of medullary cavities. this strengthens the bones while still allowing haematopoiesis.[61] both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front.[62] since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body, an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy. elephants are incapable of rotating their front legs, as the ulna and radius are fixed in pronation; the ""palm"" of the manus faces backward.[61] the pronator quadratus and the pronator teres are either reduced or absent.[63] the circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or ""cushion pads"" beneath the manus or pes, which distribute the weight of the animal.[62] they appear to have a sesamoid, an extra ""toe"" similar in placement to a giant panda's extra ""thumb"", that also helps in weight distribution.[64] as many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feet.[11] elephants can move both forwards and backwards, but cannot trot, jump, or gallop. they use only two gaits when moving on land: the walk and a faster gait similar to running.[61] in walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground. with no ""aerial phase"", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground.[65] fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of 25 km/h (16 mph).[66] at this speed, most other quadrupeds are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length. spring-like kinetics could explain the difference between the motion of elephants and other animals.[66] during locomotion, the cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving.[62] elephants are capable swimmers. they have been recorded swimming for up to six hours without touching the bottom, and have travelled as far as 48 km (30 mi) at a stretch and at speeds of up to 2.1 km/h (1 mph).[67] the brain of an elephant weighs 4.5–5.5 kg (10–12 lb) compared to 1.6 kg (4 lb) for a human brain. while the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally smaller. at birth, an elephant's brain already weighs 30–40% of its adult weight. the cerebrum and cerebellum are well developed, and the temporal lobes are so large that they bulge out laterally.[68] the throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use.[6] the larynx of the elephant is the largest known among mammals. the vocal folds are long and are attached close to the epiglottis base. when comparing an elephant's vocal folds to those of a human, an elephant's are longer, thicker, and have a larger cross-sectional area. in addition, they are tilted at 45 degrees and positioned more anteriorly than a human's vocal folds.[69] the heart of an elephant weighs 12–21 kg (26–46 lb). it has a double-pointed apex, an unusual trait among mammals.[68] in addition, the ventricles separate near the top of the heart, a trait they share with sirenians.[70] when standing, the elephant's heart beats approximately 30 times per minute. unlike many other animals, the heart rate speeds up by 8 to 10 beats per minute when the elephant is lying down.[71] the blood vessels in most of the body are wide and thick and can withstand high blood pressures.[70] the lungs are attached to the diaphragm, and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage.[68] connective tissue exists in place of the pleural cavity. this may allow the animal to deal with the pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air,[32] although this explanation has been questioned.[72] another possible function for this adaptation is that it helps the animal suck up water through the trunk.[32] elephants inhale mostly through the trunk, although some air goes through the mouth. they have a hindgut fermentation system, and their large and small intestines together reach 35 m (115 ft) in length. the majority of an elephant's food intake goes undigested despite the process lasting up to a day.[68] a male elephant's testes are located internally near the kidneys.[73] the elephant's penis can reach a length of 100 cm (39 in) and a diameter of 16 cm (6 in) at the base. it is s-shaped when fully erect and has a y-shaped orifice. the female has a well-developed clitoris at up to 40 cm (16 in). the vulva is located between the hind legs instead of near the tail as in most mammals. determining pregnancy status can be difficult due to the animal's large abdominal cavity. the female's mammary glands occupy the space between the front legs, which puts the suckling calf within reach of the female's trunk.[68] elephants have a unique organ, the temporal gland, located in both sides of the head. this organ is associated with sexual behaviour, and males secrete a fluid from it when in musth.[74] females have also been observed with secretions from the temporal glands.[46] the core body temperature averages 35.9 °c (96.6 °f), similar to that of a human. like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.[68] the african bush elephant can be found in habitats as diverse as dry savannahs, deserts, marshes, and lake shores, and in elevations from sea level to mountain areas above the snow line. forest elephants mainly live in equatorial forests but will enter gallery forests and ecotones between forests and savannahs.[12] asian elephants prefer areas with a mix of grasses, low woody plants, and trees, primarily inhabiting dry thorn-scrub forests in southern india and sri lanka and evergreen forests in malaya.[75] elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass and roots.[12] they are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.[76] african elephants are mostly browsers while asian elephants are mainly grazers. they can consume as much as 150 kg (330 lb) of food and 40 l (11 us gal) of water in a day. elephants tend to stay near water sources.[12] major feeding bouts take place in the morning, afternoon and night. at midday, elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing. sleeping occurs at night while the animal is lying down.[61][77] elephants average 3–4 hours of sleep per day.[78] both males and family groups typically move 10–20 km (6–12 mi) a day, but distances as far as 90–180 km (56–112 mi) have been recorded in the etosha region of namibia. elephants go on seasonal migrations in search of food, water, minerals, and mates.[79] at chobe national park, botswana, herds travel 325 km (202 mi) to visit the river when the local waterholes dry up.[80] because of their large size, elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered keystone species. their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. they can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. at mount elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects.[81] elephants are important seed dispersers; african forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. the seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances.[82] in asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. this ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir.[83] because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys.[81] elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems. at murchison falls national park in uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.[77] elephants typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores, which will usually stay out of their way. some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. at aberdare national park, kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group.[77] at hluhluwe–umfolozi game reserve, south africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that claimed the lives of 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males.[84] the size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators,[75] though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers.[85] calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in africa[86] and tigers in asia.[75] the lions of savuti, botswana, have adapted to hunting elephants, mostly juveniles or sub-adults, during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been normally recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years, and a bull of about 15 years in an exceptional case.[87][88] elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller predators like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); they react to leopards less fearfully and more aggressively.[89] elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. this is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.[90] female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, some of which are made up of more than ten members, including three mothers and their dependent offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female.[91] she remains leader of the group until death[86] or if she no longer has the energy for the role;[92] a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants.[93] when her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present.[86] one study found that younger matriarchs are more likely than older ones to under-react to severe danger.[94] family groups may split after becoming too large for the available resources.[95] the social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit. in the case of elephants in amboseli national park, kenya, a female's life involves interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as bond groups which typically made of two family groups. during the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan. groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. there are typically nine groups in a clan. the amboseli elephant population is further divided into the ""central"" and ""peripheral"" subpopulations.[91] some elephant populations in india and sri lanka have similar basic social organisations. there appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. they have been observed to have ""nursing units"" and ""juvenile-care units"". in southern india, elephant populations may contain family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. family groups tend to be small, consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring. a group containing more than two adult females plus offspring is known as a ""joint family"". malay elephant populations have even smaller family units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group.[91] groups of african forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring. these groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.[91] the social life of the adult male is very different. as he matures, a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. at amboseli, young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14–15. when males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. the former is typical of bulls in dense forests. asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. larger bull groups consisting of over 10 members occur only among african bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144 individuals. bulls only return to the herd to breed or to socialize, they do not provide prenatal care to their offspring but rather play a fatherly role to younger bulls to show dominance.[96] male elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates, and will form long-term relationships.[97] a dominance hierarchy exists among males, whether they range socially or solitarily. dominance depends on the age, size and sexual condition,[96] and when in groups, males follow the lead of the dominant bull. young bulls may seek out the company and leadership of older, more experienced males,[97] whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent them from exhibiting ""deviant"" behaviour.[98] adult males and females come together for reproduction. bulls associate with family groups if an oestrous cow is present.[96] a family of african bush elephants: note the protected position of the calves in the middle of the group lone bull: adult male elephants spend much of their time alone or in single-sex groups male elephants sparring adult males enter a state of increased testosterone known as musth. in a population in southern india, males first enter musth at the age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. at amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (january–may), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (june–december). the main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. he may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. this can last from a day to four months.[99] males become extremely aggressive during musth. size is the determining factor in agonistic encounters when the individuals have the same condition. in contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. a male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. serious fights are rare.[99] elephants are polygynous breeders,[100] and copulations are most frequent during the peak of the wet season.[101] a cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. a bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ.[102][103] the oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. while most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. the first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge.[104] fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.[92] bulls engage in a behaviour known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males.[105] most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females actively seek to be guarded by them, particularly older ones.[106] thus these bulls have more reproductive success.[96] musth appears to signal to females the condition of the male, as weak or injured males do not have normal musths.[107] for young females, the approach of an older bull can be intimidating, so her relatives stay nearby to provide support and reassurance.[108] during copulation, the male lays his trunk over the female's back.[109] the penis is very mobile, being able to move independently of the pelvis.[110] prior to mounting, it curves forward and upward. copulation lasts about 45 seconds and does not involve pelvic thrusting or ejaculatory pause.[111] elephant sperm must swim close to 2 m (6.6 ft) to reach the egg. by comparison, human sperm has to swim around only 76.2 mm (3.00 in).[112] homosexual behaviour is frequent in both sexes. as in heterosexual interactions, this involves mounting. male elephants sometimes stimulate each other by playfighting and ""championships"" may form between old bulls and younger males. female same-sex behaviours have been documented only in captivity where they are known to masturbate one another with their trunks.[113] gestation in elephants typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years. births tend to take place during the wet season.[114] calves are born 85 cm (33 in) tall and weigh around 120 kg (260 lb).[108] typically, only a single young is born, but twins sometimes occur.[115][116] the relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five corpus luteums (as opposed to one in most mammals) and gives the foetus more time to develop, particularly the brain and trunk.[115] as such, newborn elephants are precocial and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd.[117] a new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. for the first few days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. alloparenting – where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother – takes place in some family groups. allomothers are typically two to twelve years old.[108] for the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. it relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. it has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. by its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. after its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. it is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.[117] for its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. at the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. calves continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. by nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. after a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. it still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.[117] play behaviour in calves differs between the sexes; females run or chase each other while males play-fight. the former are sexually mature by the age of nine years[108] while the latter become mature around 14–15 years.[96] adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes.[118][119] elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age.[49] lin wang, a captive male asian elephant, lived for 86 years.[120] touching is an important form of communication among elephants. individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. this allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. touching is especially important for mother–calf communication. when moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. if a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.[121] visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. they may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. they are usually bluffing when performing these actions. excited elephants may raise their trunks. submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a v shape.[122] elephants produce several sounds, usually through the larynx, though some may be modified by the trunk.[123] perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk. trumpeting is made during excitement, distress or aggression.[111][123] fighting elephants may roar or squeal, and wounded ones may bellow.[124] rumbles are produced during mild arousal[125] and some appear to be infrasonic.[126] these calls occur at frequencies less than 20 hz.[127] infrasonic calls are important, particularly for long-distance communication,[123] in both asian and african elephants. for asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14–24 hz, with sound pressure levels of 85–90 db and last 10–15 seconds.[126] for african elephants, calls range from 15 to 35 hz with sound pressure levels as high as 117 db, allowing communication for many kilometres, with a possible maximum range of around 10 km (6 mi).[128] at amboseli, several different infrasonic calls have been identified. a greeting rumble is emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours. contact calls are soft, unmodulated sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their group and may be responded to with a ""contact answer"" call that starts out loud, but becomes softer. a ""let's go"" soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that it is time to move to another spot. bulls in musth emit a distinctive, low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the ""motorcycle"". musth rumbles may be answered by the ""female chorus"", a low-frequency, modulated chorus produced by several cows. a loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating. when a cow has mated, her family may produce calls of excitement known as the ""mating pandemonium"".[125] from various experiments, the elephant larynx is shown to produce various and complex vibratory phenomena. during in vivo situations, these phenomena could be triggered when the vocal folds and vocal tract interact to raise or lower the fundamental frequency.[127] one of the vibratory phenomena that occurred inside the larynx is alternating a-p (anterior-posterior) and p-a traveling waves, which happened due to the unusual larynx layout. this can be characterized by its unique glottal opening/closing pattern. when the trachea is at pressure of approximately 6 kpa, phonation begins in the larynx and the laryngeal tissue starts to vibrate at approximately 15 kpa. vocal production mechanisms at certain frequencies are similar to that of humans and other mammals and the laryngeal tissues are subjected to self-maintained oscillations. two biomechanical features can trigger these traveling wave patterns, which are a low fundamental frequency and in the vocal folds, increasing longitudinal tension.[69] elephants are known to communicate with seismics, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. they appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. when detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet; this is known as the ""freezing behaviour"". elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. the cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in marine mammals like toothed whales and sirenians. a unique sphincter-like muscle around the ear canal constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals.[129] elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. an individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances.[130] when detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predators, elephants enter a defensive posture and family groups will pack together. seismic waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel distances of up to 32 km (20 mi) while those from vocalisations travel 16 km (10 mi).[131] elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an indication of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins.[132] one study of a captive female asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. this individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later.[133] elephants are among the species known to use tools. an asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters.[134] tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. this could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps to allow them to remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. individuals appear to be able to keep track of the current location of their family members.[41] scientists debate the extent to which elephants feel emotion. they appear to show interest in the bones of their own kind, regardless of whether they are related.[135] as with chimps and dolphins, a dying or dead elephant may elicit attention and aid from others, including those from other groups. this has been interpreted as expressing ""concern"";[136] however, others would dispute such an interpretation as being anthropomorphic;[137][138] the oxford companion to animal behaviour (1987) advised that ""one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion"".[139] african elephants were listed as vulnerable by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) in 2008, with no independent assessment of the conservation status of the two forms.[140] in 1979, africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0 million. by 1989, the population was estimated to be 609,000; with 277,000 in central africa, 110,000 in eastern africa, 204,000 in southern africa, and 19,000 in western africa. about 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. from 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in east africa. after 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from cameroon to somalia experienced a decline of 80%. african forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. population trends in southern africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in zambia, mozambique and angola while populations grew in botswana and zimbabwe and were stable in south africa.[141] conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%.[140] due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total african elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork. the iucn estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012 while traffic estimates as many as 55 are poached daily.[142][143] african elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found, but 70% of their range exists outside protected areas. successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities. as of 2008, local numbers were controlled by contraception or translocation. large-scale cullings ceased in 1988, when zimbabwe abandoned the practice. in 1989, the african elephant was listed under appendix i by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora (cites), making trade illegal. appendix ii status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in botswana, namibia, and zimbabwe in 1997 and south africa in 2000. in some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal; botswana, cameroon, gabon, mozambique, namibia, south africa, tanzania, zambia, and zimbabwe have cites export quotas for elephant trophies.[140] in june 2016, the first lady of kenya, margaret kenyatta, helped launch the east africa grass-root elephant education campaign walk, organised by elephant conservationist jim nyamu. the event was conducted to raise awareness of the value of elephants and rhinos, to help mitigate human-elephant conflicts, and to promote anti-poaching activities.[144] in 2008, the iucn listed the asian elephant as endangered due to a 50% population decline over the past 60–75 years[145] while cites lists the species under appendix i.[145] asian elephants once ranged from syria and iraq (the subspecies elephas maximus asurus), to china (up to the yellow river)[146] and java. it is now extinct in these areas,[145] and the current range of asian elephants is highly fragmented.[146] the total population of asian elephants is estimated to be around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. it is likely that around half of the population is in india. although asian elephants are declining in numbers overall, particularly in southeast asia, the population in the western ghats appears to be increasing.[145] the poaching of elephants for their ivory, meat and hides has been one of the major threats to their existence.[145] historically, numerous cultures made ornaments and other works of art from elephant ivory, and its use rivalled that of gold.[148] the ivory trade contributed to the african elephant population decline in the late 20th century.[140] this prompted international bans on ivory imports, starting with the united states in june 1989, and followed by bans in other north american countries, western european countries, and japan.[148] around the same time, kenya destroyed all its ivory stocks.[149] cites approved an international ban on ivory that went into effect in january 1990. following the bans, unemployment rose in india and china, where the ivory industry was important economically. by contrast, japan and hong kong, which were also part of the industry, were able to adapt and were not badly affected.[148] zimbabwe, botswana, namibia, zambia, and malawi wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to, since their local elephant populations were healthy, but only if their supplies were from elephants that had been culled or died of natural causes.[149] the ban allowed the elephant to recover in parts of africa.[148] in january 2012, 650 elephants in bouba njida national park, cameroon, were killed by chadian raiders.[150] this has been called ""one of the worst concentrated killings"" since the ivory ban.[149] asian elephants are potentially less vulnerable to the ivory trade, as females usually lack tusks. still, members of the species have been killed for their ivory in some areas, such as periyar national park in india.[145] china was the biggest market for poached ivory but announced they would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in may 2015, and in september 2015, china and the united states said ""they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import and export of ivory"" due to causes of extinction.[151] other threats to elephants include habitat destruction and fragmentation.[140] the asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations. because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment. in extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation.[145] one proposed solution is the provision of 'urban corridors' which allow the animals access to key areas.[152] elephants have been working animals since at least the indus valley civilization[153] and continue to be used in modern times. there were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in asia in 2000. these animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life.[154] they were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.[155] individuals of the asian species have been often trained as working animals. asian elephants perform tasks such as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions.[154] in northern thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for black ivory coffee.[156] they are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands.[154] musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous to work with and are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes.[157] in india, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. they and other captive elephants are thus protected under the prevention of cruelty to animals act of 1960.[158] in both myanmar and thailand, deforestation and other economic factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting in health problems for the elephants themselves as well as economic and safety problems for the people amongst whom they live.[159][160] the practice of working elephants has also been attempted in africa. the taming of african elephants in the belgian congo began by decree of leopold ii of belgium during the 19th century and continues to the present with the api elephant domestication centre.[161] historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. they were equipped with armour to protect their sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough. war elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him.[162] one of the earliest references to war elephants is in the indian epic mahabharata (written in the 4th century bc, but said to describe events between the 11th and 8th centuries bc). they were not used as much as horse-drawn chariots by either the pandavas or kauravas. during the magadha kingdom (which began in the 6th century bc), elephants began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses, and later indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively; 3,000 of them were used in the nandas (5th and 4th centuries bc) army while 9,000 may have been used in the mauryan army (between the 4th and 2nd centuries bc). the arthashastra (written around 300 bc) advised the mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild elephants for use in the army, and to execute anyone who killed them.[163] from south asia, the use of elephants in warfare spread west to persia[162] and east to southeast asia.[164] the persians used them during the achaemenid empire (between the 6th and 4th centuries bc)[162] while southeast asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the 5th century bc and continued to the 20th century.[164] in his 326 b.c. indian campaign, alexander the great confronted elephants for the first time, and suffered heavy casualties. among the reasons for the refusal of the rank-and-file macedonian soldiers to continue the indian conquest were rumors of even larger elephant armies in india.[165] alexander trained his foot soldiers to injure the animals and cause them to panic during wars with both the persians and indians. ptolemy, who was one of alexander's generals, used corps of asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of egypt (which began in 323 bc). his son and successor ptolemy ii (who began his rule in 285 bc) obtained his supply of elephants further south in nubia. from then on, war elephants were employed in the mediterranean and north africa throughout the classical period. the greek king pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of rome in 280 bc. while they frightened the roman horses, they were not decisive and pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. the carthaginian general hannibal took elephants across the alps during his war with the romans and reached the po valley in 217 bc with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.[162] overall, elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked. with time, strategists devised counter-measures and war elephants turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by romans and parthians.[165] elephants were historically kept for display in the menageries of ancient egypt, china, greece, and rome. the romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events. in the modern era, elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world. in circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. the most famous circus elephant was probably jumbo (1861 – 15 september 1885), who was a major attraction in the barnum & bailey circus.[166] these animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. asian elephants were always more common than their african counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. after cites listed the asian elephant under appendix i in 1975, the number of african elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of asians continued. subsequently, the us received many of its captive african elephants from zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.[167] as of 2000, around 1,200 asian and 700 african elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. the largest captive population is in north america, which has an estimated 370 asian and 350 african elephants. about 380 asians and 190 africans are known to exist in europe, and japan has around 70 asians and 67 africans.[167] keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress.[168] elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. this has been observed in 54% of individuals in uk zoos.[169] elephants in european zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.[170] the use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial; the humane society of the united states has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals.[171] in testimony to a us federal court in 2009, barnum & bailey circus ceo kenneth feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. despite this, he denied that any of these practices harm elephants.[172] some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. ralph helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions.[173] ringling bros. and barnum and bailey circus retired its touring elephants in may 2016.[174] african elephants at the barcelona zoo circus poster, c. 1900 elephants can exhibit bouts of aggressive behaviour and engage in destructive actions against humans.[175] in africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive.[176][177] in parts of india, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in jharkhand while in assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.[175] local people have reported their belief that some elephants were drunk during their attacks, although officials have disputed this explanation.[178][179] purportedly drunk elephants attacked an indian village a second time in december 2002, killing six people, which led to the killing of about 200 elephants by locals.[180] in many cultures, elephants represent strength, power, wisdom, longevity, stamina, leadership, sociability, nurturance and loyalty.[181][182][183] several cultural references emphasise the elephant's size and exotic uniqueness. for instance, a ""white elephant"" is a byword for something expensive, useless, and bizarre.[184] the expression ""elephant in the room"" refers to an obvious truth that is ignored or otherwise unaddressed.[185] the story of the blind men and an elephant teaches that reality can be observed from different perspectives.[186] elephants have been represented in art since paleolithic times. africa, in particular, contains many rock paintings and engravings of the animals, especially in the sahara and southern africa.[187] in asia, the animals are depicted as motifs in hindu and buddhist shrines and temples.[188] elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first-hand experience of them.[189] the ancient romans, who kept the animals in captivity, depicted anatomically accurate elephants on mosaics in tunisia and sicily. at the beginning of the middle ages, when europeans had little to no access to the animals, elephants were portrayed more like fantasy creatures. they were often depicted with horse- or bovine-like bodies with trumpet-like trunks and tusks like a boar; some were even given hooves. elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the gothic churches. as more elephants began to be sent to european kings as gifts during the 15th century, depictions of them became more accurate, including one made by leonardo da vinci. despite this, some europeans continued to portray them in a more stylised fashion.[190] max ernst's 1921 surrealist painting, the elephant celebes, depicts an elephant as a silo with a trunk-like hose protruding from it.[191] elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs. the mbuti people of central africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants.[188] similar ideas existed among other african societies, who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. during the 10th century ad, the people of igbo-ukwu, near the niger delta, buried their leaders with elephant tusks.[192] the animals' religious importance is only totemic in africa[193] but is much more significant in asia. in sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. likewise in hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as airavata, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows.[188] one of the most important hindu deities, the elephant-headed ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods shiva, vishnu, and brahma.[194] ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires.[188] in buddhism, buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human.[195] in islamic tradition, the year 570 when muhammad was born is known as the year of the elephant.[196] elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.[188] elephants are ubiquitous in western popular culture as emblems of the exotic, especially since – as with the giraffe, hippopotamus and rhinoceros – there are no similar animals familiar to western audiences.[184] the use of the elephant as a symbol of the u.s. republican party began with an 1874 cartoon by thomas nast.[197] as characters, elephants are most common in children's stories, in which they are generally cast as models of exemplary behaviour. they are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values. many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to a close-knit community, such as ""the elephant's child"" from rudyard kipling's just so stories, disney's dumbo, and kathryn and byron jackson's the saggy baggy elephant. other elephant heroes given human qualities include jean de brunhoff's babar, david mckee's elmer, and dr. seuss's horton.[184] parable of the elephant

bison," bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus bison within the subfamily bovinae. two extant and six extinct species are recognised. of the six extinct species, five became extinct in the quaternary extinction event. bison palaeosinensis evolved in the early pleistocene in south asia, and was the evolutionary ancestor of b. priscus (steppe bison), which was the ancestor of all other bison species. from 2 million years ago to 6,000 bc, steppe bison ranged across the mammoth steppe, inhabiting europe and northern asia with b. schoetensacki (woodland bison), and north america with b. antiquus, b. latifrons, and b. occidentalis. the last species to go extinct, b. occidentalis, was succeeded at 3,000 bc by b. bison. of the two surviving species, the american bison, b. bison, found only in north america, is the more numerous. although commonly known as a buffalo in the united states and canada,[2] it is only distantly related to the true buffalo. the north american species is composed of two subspecies, the plains bison, b. b. bison, and the wood bison, b. b. athabascae, which is the namesake of wood buffalo national park in canada. a third subspecies, the eastern bison (b. b. pennsylvanicus) is no longer considered a valid taxon, being a junior synonym of b. b. bison.[3] references to ""woods bison"" or ""wood bison"" from the eastern united states confusingly refer to this subspecies, not b. b. athabascae, which was not found in the region. the european bison, b. bonasus, or wisent, is found in europe and the caucasus, reintroduced after being extinct in the wild. while all bison species are classified in their own genus, they are sometimes bred with domestic cattle (genus bos) and produce sometimes fertile offspring called beefalo or zubron. the american bison and the european bison (wisent) are the largest surviving terrestrial animals in north america and europe. they are typical artiodactyl (cloven hooved) ungulates, and are similar in appearance to other bovines such as cattle and true buffalo. they are broad and muscular with shaggy coats of long hair. adults grow up to 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) in height and 3.5 m (11 ft 6 in) in length for american bison[4][5] and up to 2.1 m (6 ft 11 in) in height[6] and 2.9 m (9 ft 6 in) in length for european bison.[7] american bison can weigh from around 400 to 1,270 kilograms (880 to 2,800 pounds)[5][8] and european bison can weigh from 800 to 1,000 kg (1,800 to 2,200 lb).[7] european bison tend to be taller than american bison. bison are nomadic grazers and travel in herds. the bulls leave the herds of females at two or three years of age, and join a herd of males, which are generally smaller than female herds. mature bulls rarely travel alone. towards the end of the summer, for the reproductive season, the sexes necessarily commingle.[9] american bison are known for living in the great plains, but formerly had a much larger range, including much of the eastern united states and parts of mexico. both species were hunted close to extinction during the 19th and 20th centuries, but have since rebounded. the wisent in part owes its survival to the chernobyl disaster, as the chernobyl exclusion zone has become a kind of wildlife preserve for wisent and other rare megafauna such as the przewalski's horse, though poaching has become a threat in recent years.[10] the american plains bison is no longer listed as endangered, but this does not mean the species is secure. genetically pure b. b. bison currently number only about 20,000, separated into fragmented herds—all of which require active conservation measures.[11] the wood bison is on the endangered species list in canada[12] and is listed as threatened in the united states, though numerous attempts have been made by beefalo ranchers to have it entirely removed from the endangered species list.[13] although superficially similar, physical and behavioural differences exist between the american and european bison. the american species has 15 ribs, while the european bison has 14. the american bison has four lumbar vertebrae, while the european has five.[14] (the difference in this case is that what would be the first lumbar vertebra has ribs attached to it in american bison and is thus counted as the 15th thoracic vertebra, compared to 14 thoracic vertebrae in wisent.) adult american bison are less slim in build and have shorter legs.[15] american bison tend to graze more, and browse less than their european relatives. their anatomies reflect this behavioural difference; the american bison's head hangs lower than the european's. the body of the american bison is typically hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the european bison. the horns of the european bison point through the plane of their faces, making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the american bison, which favours butting.[16] american bison are more easily tamed than their european cousins, and breed with domestic cattle more readily.[17] the bovine tribe (bovini) split about 5 to 10 million years ago into the buffalos (bubalus and syncerus) and a group leading to bison and taurine cattle.[18] thereafter, the family lineage of bison and taurine cattle does not appear to be a straightforward ""tree"" structure as is often depicted in much evolution, because evidence of interbreeding and crossbreeding is seen between different species and members within this family, even many millions of years after their ancestors separated into different species. this crossbreeding was not sufficient to conflate the different species back together, but it has resulted in unexpected relationships between many members of this group, such as yak being related to american bison, when such relationships would otherwise not be apparent. a 2003 study of mitochondrial dna indicated four distinct maternal lineages in tribe bovini: however, y chromosome analysis associated wisent and american bison.[20] an earlier study using amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting showed a close association of wisent with american bison, and probably with the yak, but noted that the interbreeding of bovini species made determining relationships problematic.[21] the genus bison diverged from the lineage that led to cattle (bos primigenius) at the plio-pleistocene boundary in south asia.[22] two extant and six extinct species are recognised. of the six extinct species, five went extinct in the quaternary extinction event. three were north american endemics: bison antiquus, b. latifrons, and b. occidentalis. the fourth, b. priscus (steppe bison), ranged across steppe environments from western europe, through central asia, east asia including japan,[23][24] and onto north america. the fifth, b. schoetensacki. (woodland bison), inhabited eurasian forests, extending from western europe to the south of siberia.[25] the sixth, b. palaeosinensis, evolving in the early pleistocene in south asia,[22] is presumed to have been the evolutionary ancestor of b. priscus and all successive bison lineages.[26] the steppe bison (b. priscus) evolved from bison palaeosinensis in the early pleistocene. b. priscus is seen clearly in the fossil record around 2 million years ago.[27] the steppe bison spread across eurasia, and all proceeding contemporary and successive species are believed to have derived from the steppe bison. going extinct around 6,000 bce in siberia and around 5,400 bce in alaska,[28][29] outlasted only by b. occidentalis, b. bonasus and b. bison, the steppe bison was the predominant bison pictured in the ancient cave paintings of spain and southern france. the modern european bison is likely to have arisen from the steppe bison. there is no direct fossil evidence of successive species between the steppe bison and the european bison, though there are three possible lines of ancestry pertaining to the european wisent. past research has suggested that the european bison is descended from bison that had migrated from asia to north america, and then back to europe, where they crossbred with existing steppe bison.[27] however, more recent phylogenetic research points to an origin either from the phenotypically and genetically similar pleistocene woodland bison (b. schoetensacki)[25] or as the result of an interbreeding event between the steppe bison and the aurochs (bos primigenius), the ancestor of domesticated cattle, around 120,000 years ago.[30] the possible hybrid is referred to in vernacular as the 'higgs bison' as a hat-tip to the discovery process of the higgs boson.[31] at one point, some steppe bison crossbred with the ancestors of the modern yak. after that crossbreeding, a population of steppe bison crossed the bering land bridge to north america. the steppe bison spread through the northern parts of north america and lived in eurasia until around 11,000 years ago[32] and north america until 4,000 to 8,000 years ago.[27] the pleistocene woodland bison (b. schoetensacki) evolved in the middle pleistocene from b. priscus, and tended to inhabit the dry conifer forests and woodland which lined the mammoth steppe, occupying a range from western europe to the south of siberia. although their fossil records are far rarer than their antecedent, they are thought to have existed until at least 36,000 bce.[22][25] bison latifrons (the ""giant"" or ""longhorn"" bison) is thought to have evolved in midcontinent north america from b. priscus, after the steppe bison crossed into north america.[33][34][35] giant bison (b. latifrons) appeared in the fossil record about 120,000 years ago.[27] b. latifrons was one of many species of north american megafauna that became extinct during the transition from the pleistocene to the holocene epoch (an event referred to as the quaternary extinction event). it is thought to have disappeared some 21,000–30,000 years ago, during the late wisconsin glaciation.[36] b. latifrons co-existed with the slightly smaller b. antiquus for over 100,000 years. their predecessor, the steppe bison appeared in the north american fossil record around 190,000 years ago.[37] b. latifrons is believed to have been a more woodland-dwelling, non-herding species, while b. antiquus was a herding grassland-dweller, very much like its descendant b. bison.[38] b. antiquus gave rise to both b. occidentalis, and later b. bison, the modern american bison, some 5,000 to 10,000 years ago.[39][40] b. antiquus was the most common megafaunal species on the north american continent during much of the late pleistocene and is the most commonly found large animal found at the la brea tar pits.[41] in 2016, dna extracted from bison priscus fossil remains beneath a 130,000-year-old volcanic ashfall in the yukon suggested recent arrival of the species. that genetic material indicated that all american bison had a common ancestor 135,000 to 195,000 years ago, during which period the bering land bridge was exposed; this hypothesis precludes an earlier arrival. the researchers sequenced mitochondrial genomes from both that specimen and from the remains of a recently discovered, estimated 120,000-year-old giant, long-horned, b. latifrons from snowmass, colorado. the genetic information also indicated that a second, pleistocene migration of bison over the land bridge occurred 21,000 to 45,000 years ago.[42][43] during the population bottleneck, after the great slaughter of american bison during the 19th century, the number of bison remaining alive in north america declined to as low as 541. during that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. these ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce ""cattleo""[44] (today called ""beefalo"") accidental crossings were also known to occur. generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. the crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. wisent-american bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in germany (and found to be fully fertile) and a herd of such animals is maintained in russia. a herd of cattle-wisent crossbreeds (zubron) is maintained in poland. first-generation crosses do not occur naturally, requiring caesarean delivery. first-generation males are infertile. the u.s. national bison association has adopted a code of ethics that prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species. in the united states, many ranchers are now using dna testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. the proportion of cattle dna that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%.[44][45] there are also remnant purebred american bison herds on public lands in north america. herds of importance are found in yellowstone national park, wind cave national park in south dakota, blue mounds state park in minnesota, elk island national park in alberta, and grasslands national park in saskatchewan. in 2015, a purebred herd of 350 individuals was identified on public lands in the henry mountains of southern utah via genetic testing of mitochondrial and nuclear dna.[46] this study, published in 2015, also showed the henry mountains bison herd to be free of brucellosis, a bacterial disease that was imported with non-native domestic cattle to north america.[47] wallowing is a common behavior of bison. a bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil, either wet or dry. bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with mud or dust. possible explanations suggested for wallowing behavior include grooming behavior associated with moulting, male-male interaction (typically rutting behavior), social behavior for group cohesion, play behavior, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of ectoparasite load (ticks and lice), and thermoregulation.[48] in the process of wallowing, bison may become infected by the fatal disease anthrax, which may occur naturally in the soil.[49] bison temperament is often unpredictable. they usually appear peaceful, unconcerned, even lazy, yet they may attack anything, often without warning or apparent reason. they can move at speeds up to 56 km/h (35 mph) and cover long distances at a lumbering gallop.[50] their most obvious weapons are the horns borne by both males and females, but their massive heads can be used as battering rams, effectively using the momentum produced by what is a typical weight of 900 to 1,200 kilograms (2,000 to 2,700 lb) moving at 50 km/h (30 mph). the hind legs can also be used to kill or maim with devastating effect. in the words of early naturalists, they were dangerous, savage animals that feared no other animal and in prime condition could best any foe[50] (except for wolves and brown bears[9][51]). the rutting, or mating, season lasts from june through september, with peak activity in july and august. at this time, the older bulls rejoin the herd, and fights often take place between bulls. the herd exhibits much restlessness during breeding season. the animals are belligerent, unpredictable, and most dangerous.[50] american bison live in river valleys, and on prairies and plains. typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison. they also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep. though not particularly known as high-altitude animals, bison in the yellowstone park bison herd are frequently found at elevations above 8,000 feet and the henry mountains bison herd is found on the plains around the henry mountains, utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the henry mountains to an altitude of 10,000 feet. european bison most commonly live in lightly wooded to fully wooded areas, as well as areas with increased shrubs and bushes. european bison can be found living on grasslands and plains as well, but are not as common. throughout most of their historical range, landowners have sought restrictions on free-ranging bison. herds on private land are required to be fenced in.[52] in the state of montana, free-ranging bison on public lands may be shot, due to concerns about transmission of disease to cattle and damage to public property.[53] in 2013, montana legislative measures concerning the bison were proposed and passed the legislature, but opposed by native american tribes as they impinged on sovereign tribal rights. three such bills were vetoed by steve bullock, the governor of montana. the bison's circumstances remain an issue of contention between native american tribes and private landowners.[54] bison are ruminants, which gives them the ability to ferment plants in a specialized stomach prior to digesting them. bison were once thought to almost exclusively consume grasses and sedges, but are now known to consume a wide-variety of plants including woody plants and herbaceous eudicots.[55][56] over the course of the year, bison shift which plants they select in their diet based on which plants have the highest protein or energy concentrations at a given time and will reliably consume the same species of plants across years.[55] protein concentrations of the plants they eat tend to be highest in the spring and decline thereafter, reaching their lowest in the winter.[55] in yellowstone national park, bison browsed willows and cottonwoods, not only in the winter when few other plants are available, but also in the summer.[57] bison are thought to migrate to optimize their diet,[58] and will concentrate their feeding on recently burned areas due to the higher quality forage that regrows after the burn.[59] wisent tend to browse on shrubs and low-hanging trees more often than do the american bison, which prefer grass to shrubbery and trees.[60] female bison typically do not reproduce until three years of age[61] and can reproduce to at least 19 years of age.[62] female bison can produce calves annually as long as their nutrition is sufficient, but will not give birth to a calf after years where weight gain was too low. a mother's probability of reproduction the following year is strongly dependent on the mother's mass and age.[62] heavier female bison produce heavier calves (weighed in the fall at weaning) than light mothers, while the weight of calves is lower for older mothers (after age 8).[62] owing to their size, bison have few predators. five notable exceptions are humans, grey wolves, cougars, brown bears, and coyotes.[63] the grey wolf generally takes down a bison while in a pack, but cases of a single wolf killing bison have been reported.[51] brown bears also consume bison, often by driving off the pack and consuming the wolves' kill.[9] brown bears and coyotes also prey on bison calves. historically and prehistorically, lions, cave lions, tigers, the dire wolf, smilodon, homotherium, cave hyenas and homo sp. had posed threats to bison. for the american bison, the main cause of illness is malignant catarrhal fever,[64] though brucellosis is a serious concern in the yellowstone park bison herd. bison in the antelope island bison herd are regularly inoculated against brucellosis, parasites, clostridium infection, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and bovine vibriosis.[65] the major concerns for illness in european bison are foot-and-mouth disease and balanoposthitis, which affects the male sex organs; a number of parasitic diseases have also been cited as threats.[66] the inbreeding of the species caused by the small population plays a role in a number of genetic defects and immunity to diseases, which in turn poses greater risks to the population.[66] the term ""buffalo"" is sometimes considered to be a misnomer for this animal, as it is only distantly related to either of the two ""true buffalo"", the asian water buffalo and the african buffalo. samuel de champlain applied the term buffalo (buffles in french) to the bison in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the nipissing first nation, who said they travelled 40 days (from east of lake huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals.[67] though ""bison"" might be considered more scientifically correct, as a result of standard usage, ""buffalo"" is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for american buffalo or bison. buffalo has a much longer history than bison, which was first recorded in 1774.[68] bison was a significant resource for indigenous peoples of north america for food and raw materials until near extinction in the late 19th century. in fact, for the indigenous peoples of the plains, it was their principal food source.[69] native americans highly valued their relationship with the bison, saw them as sacred, and treated them in such a respectful way as to ensure their ongoing longevity and abundance. in his biography, lakota teacher and elder john fire lame deer describes the relationship as such:[70] the buffalo gave us everything we needed. without it we were nothing. our tipis were made of his skin. his hide was our bed, our blanket, our winter coat. it was our drum, throbbing through the night, alive, holy. out of his skin we made our water bags. his flesh strengthened us, became flesh of our flesh. not the smallest part of it was wasted. his stomach, a red-hot stone dropped into it, became our soup kettle. his horns were our spoons, the bones our knives, our women's awls and needles. out of his sinews we made our bowstrings and thread. his ribs were fashioned into sleds for our children, his hoofs became rattles. his mighty skull, with the pipe leaning against it, was our sacred altar. the name of the greatest of all sioux was tatanka iyotake—sitting bull. when you killed off the buffalo you also killed the indian—the real, natural, ""wild"" indian. humans, notably european settlers, were almost exclusively accountable for the near-extinction of the american bison in the 1800s. at the beginning of the century, tens of millions of bison roamed north america. pioneers and settlers slaughtered an estimated 50 million bison during the 19th century, although the causes of decline and the numbers killed are disputed and debated.[71][72] railroads were advertising ""hunting by rail"", where trains encountered large herds alongside or crossing the tracks. men aboard fired from the train's roof or windows, leaving countless animals to rot where they died.[73] this overhunting was in part motivated by the u.s. government's desire to limit the range and power of indigenous plains indians whose diets and cultures depended on the buffalo herds.[74] the overhunting of the bison reduced their population to hundreds.[75] attempts to revive the american bison have been highly successful; farming has increased their population to nearly 150,000. the american bison is, therefore, no longer considered an endangered species,[75] however, most of these animals are actually hybrids with domestic cattle and only two populations in yellowstone national park, usa and elk island national park, canada are genetically pure bison.[76] as of july 2015, an estimated 4,900 bison lived in yellowstone national park, the largest u.s. bison population on public land.[77] during 1983–1985 visitors experienced 33 bison-related injuries (range = 10–13/year), so the park implemented education campaigns. after years of success, five injuries associated with bison encounters occurred in 2015, because visitors did not maintain the required distance of 75 ft (23 m) from bison while hiking or taking pictures.[78] bison is an excellent source of complete protein and a rich source (20% or more of the daily value, dv) of multiple vitamins, including riboflavin, niacin, vitamin b6, and vitamin b12, and is also a rich source of minerals, including iron, phosphorus, and zinc. additionally, bison is a good source (10% or more of the dv) of thiamine. the earliest plausible accounts of captive bison are those of the zoo at tenochtitlan, the aztec capital, which held an animal the spaniards called ""the mexican bull"".[79] in 1552, francisco lopez de gomara described plains indians herding and leading bison like cattle in his controversial book, historia general de las indias. gomara, having never visited the americas himself, likely misinterpreted early ethnographic accounts as the more familiar pastoralist relationship of the old world.[80] today, bison are increasingly raised for meat, hides, wool, and dairy products. the majority of bison in the world are raised for human consumption or fur clothing. bison meat is generally considered to taste very similar to beef, but is lower in fat and cholesterol, yet higher in protein than beef, which has led to the development of beefalo, a fertile hybrid of bison and domestic cattle. a market even exists for kosher bison meat; these bison are slaughtered at one of the few kosher mammal slaughterhouses in the u.s. and canada, and the meat is then distributed worldwide.[81][82][83] in america, the commercial industry for bison has been slow to develop despite individuals, such as ted turner, who have long marketed bison meat. in the 1990s, turner found limited success with restaurants for high-quality cuts of meat, which include bison steaks and tenderloin.[84] lower-quality cuts suitable for hamburger and hot dogs have been described as ""almost nonexistent"".[84] this created a marketing problem for commercial farming because the majority of usable meat, about 400 pounds for each bison, is suitable for these products.[84] in 2003, the united states department of agriculture purchased $10 million worth of frozen overstock to save the industry, which would later recover through better use of consumer marketing.[85] restaurants have played a role in popularizing bison meat, like ted's montana grill, which added bison to their menus. ruby tuesday first offered bison on their menus in 2005.[85] in canada, commercial bison farming began in the mid-1980s, concerning an unknown number of animals then.[83] the first census of the bison occurred in 1996, which recorded 45,235 bison on 745 farms, and grew to 195,728 bison on 1,898 farms for the 2006 census.[83] several pet food companies use bison as a red meat alternative in dog foods. the companies producing these formulas include natural balance pet foods, freshpet, the blue buffalo company, solid gold, canidae, and taste of the wild (made by diamond pet foods, inc., owned by schell and kampeter, inc.).[86] "
fox," all other species in canini foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family canidae. foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush). twelve species belong to the monophyletic ""true foxes"" group of genus vulpes. approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the south american foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.[1] foxes live on every continent except antarctica. by far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] the global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. the hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in europe, especially in the british isles, was exported by european settlers to various parts of the new world. the word fox comes from old english, which derived from proto-germanic *fuhsaz.[nb 1] this in turn derives from proto-indo-european *puḱ-, meaning ’thick-haired; tail’.[nb 2] male foxes are known as dogs, tods or reynards, females as vixens, and young as cubs, pups, or kits, though the latter name is not to be confused with a distinct species called kit foxes. vixen is one of very few words in modern english that retains the middle english southern dialect ""v"" pronunciation instead of ""f"" (i.e. northern english ""fox"" versus southern english ""vox"").[3] a group of foxes is referred to as a skulk, leash, or earth.[4][5] within the canidae, the results of dna analysis shows several phylogenetic divisions: foxes are generally smaller than some other members of the family canidae such as wolves and jackals, while they may be larger than some within the family, such as raccoon dogs. in the largest species, the red fox, males weigh on average between 4.1 and 8.7 kilograms (9 and 19 1⁄4 pounds),[7] while the smallest species, the fennec fox, weighs just 0.7 to 1.6 kg (1 1⁄2 to 3 1⁄2 lb).[8] foxy features typically include a triangular face, pointed ears, an elongated rostrum, and a bushy tail. foxes are digitigrade; they walk on their toes. unlike most members of the family canidae, foxes have partially retractable claws.[9] fox vibrissae, or whiskers, are black. the whiskers on the muzzle, mystaciae vibrissae, average 100–110 millimetres (3 7⁄8–4 3⁄8 inches) long, while the whiskers everywhere else on the head average to be shorter in length. whiskers (carpal vibrissae) are also on the forelimbs and average 40 mm (1 5⁄8 in) long, pointing downward and backward.[2] other physical characteristics vary according to habitat and adaptive significance. fox species differ in fur color, length, and density. coat colors range from pearly white to black-and-white to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted to life in the desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool.[2][9] arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick, insulating fur, which aid in keeping the body warm.[10] red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with a white marking.[11] a fox's coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months. to get rid of the dense winter coat, foxes moult once a year around april; the process begins from the feet, up the legs, and then along the back.[9] coat color may also change as the individual ages.[2] a fox's dentition, like all other canids, is i 3/3, c 1/1, pm 4/4, m 3/2 = 42. (bat-eared foxes have six extra molars, totalling in 48 teeth.) foxes have pronounced carnassial pairs, which is characteristic of a carnivore. these pairs consist of the upper premolar and the lower first molar, and work together to shear tough material like flesh. foxes' canines are pronounced, also characteristic of a carnivore, and are excellent in gripping prey.[12] in the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years, although individuals may live up to ten years. unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. typically, they live in small family groups, but some (such as arctic foxes) are known to be solitary.[2][9] foxes are omnivores.[13][14] their diet is made up primarily of invertebrates such as insects and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds. they may also eat eggs and vegetation. many species are generalist predators, but some (such as the crab-eating fox) have more specialized diets. most species of fox consume around 1 kg (2.2 lb) of food every day. foxes cache excess food, burying it for later consumption, usually under leaves, snow, or soil.[9][15] while hunting, foxes tend to use a particular pouncing technique, such that they crouch down to camouflage themselves in the terrain and then use their hind legs to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey.[2] using their pronounced canine teeth, they can then grip the prey's neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweled.[2] the gray fox is one of only two canine species known to regularly climb trees; the other is the raccoon dog.[16] the male fox's scrotum is held up close to the body with the testes inside even after they descend. like other canines, the male fox has a baculum, or penile bone.[2][17][18] the testes of red foxes are smaller than those of arctic foxes.[19] sperm formation in red foxes begins in august–september, with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in december–february.[20] vixens are in heat for one to six days, making their reproductive cycle twelve months long. as with other canines, the ova are shed during estrus without the need for the stimulation of copulating. once the egg is fertilized, the vixen enters a period of gestation that can last from 52 to 53 days. foxes tend to have an average litter size of four to five with an 80 percent success rate in becoming pregnant.[2][21] litter sizes can vary greatly according to species and environment – the arctic fox, for example, can have up to eleven kits.[22] the vixen usually has six or eight mammae.[23] each teat has 8 to 20 lactiferous ducts, which connect the mammary gland to the nipple, allowing for milk to be carried to the nipple.[citation needed] the fox's vocal repertoire is vast: in the case of domesticated foxes, the whining seems to remain in adult individuals as a sign of excitement and submission in the presence of their owners.[2] canids commonly known as foxes include the following genera and species:[2] several fox species are endangered in their native environments. pressures placed on foxes include habitat loss and being hunted for pelts, other trade, or control.[25] due in part to their opportunistic hunting style and industriousness, foxes are commonly resented as nuisance animals.[26] on the other hand, foxes, while often considered pests themselves, have been successfully employed to control pests on fruit farms while leaving the fruit intact.[27] the island fox, though considered a near-threatened species throughout the world, is becoming increasingly endangered in its endemic environment of the california channel islands.[28] a population on an island is smaller than those on the mainland because of limited resources like space, food and shelter.[29] island populations, therefore, are highly susceptible to external threats ranging from introduced predatory species and humans to extreme weather.[29] on the california channel islands, it was found that the population of the island fox was so low due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus from 1999 to 2000[30] as well as predation by non-native golden eagles.[31] since 1993, the eagles have caused the population to decline by as much as 95%.[30] because of the low number of foxes, the population went through an allee effect; this is where at low enough densities, an individual's fitness decreases.[28] conservationists, therefore, had to take healthy breeding pairs out of the wild population to breed them in captivity until they had enough foxes to release back into the wild.[30] nonnative grazers were also removed so that native plants would be able to grow back to their natural height, thereby providing adequate cover and protection for the foxes against golden eagles.[31] darwin's fox is considered critically endangered because of their small known population of 250 mature individuals as well as their restricted distribution.[32] on the chilean mainland, the population is limited to nahuelbuta national park and the surrounding valdivian rainforest.[32] similarly on chiloé island, their population is limited to the forests that extend from the southernmost to the northwesternmost part of the island.[32] though the nahuelbuta national park is protected, 90% of the species live on chiloé island.[33] a major problem the species faces, therefore, is their dwindling, limited habitat due to the cutting and burning of the unprotected forests.[32] because of deforestation, the darwin's fox habitat is shrinking, allowing for their competitor's (chilla fox) preferred habitat of open space, to increase; the darwin's fox, subsequently, is being outcompeted.[34] another problem they face is their inability to fight off diseases transmitted by the increasing number of pet dogs.[32] to conserve these animals, researchers suggest the need for the forests that link the nahuelbuta national park to the coast of chile and in turn chiloé island and its forests, to be protected.[34] they also suggest that other forests around chile be examined to determine whether darwin's foxes have previously existed there or can live there in the future, should the need to reintroduce the species to those areas arise.[34] and finally, the researchers advise for the creation of a captive breeding program, in chile, because of the limited number of mature individuals in the wild.[34] foxes are often considered pests or nuisance creatures for their opportunistic attacks on poultry and other small livestock. fox attacks on humans are not common.[35] many foxes adapt well to human environments, with several species classified as ""resident urban carnivores"" for their ability to sustain populations entirely within urban boundaries.[36] foxes in urban areas can live longer and can have smaller litter sizes than foxes in non-urban areas.[36] urban foxes are ubiquitous in europe, where they show altered behaviors compared to non-urban foxes, including increased population density, smaller territory, and pack foraging.[37] foxes have been introduced in numerous locations, with varying effects on indigenous flora and fauna.[38] in some countries, foxes are major predators of rabbits and hens. population oscillations of these two species were the first nonlinear oscillation studied, and led to the derivation of the lotka–volterra equation.[39][40] fox hunting originated in the united kingdom in the 16th century. hunting with dogs is now banned in the united kingdom,[41][42][43][44] though hunting without dogs is still permitted. red foxes were introduced into australia in the early 19th century for sport, and have since become widespread through much of the country. they have caused population decline among many native species and prey on livestock, especially new lambs.[45] fox hunting is practiced as recreation in several other countries including canada, france, ireland, italy, russia, united states and australia. there are many records of domesticated red foxes and others, but rarely of sustained domestication. a recent and notable exception is the russian silver fox,[46] which resulted in visible and behavioral changes, and is a case study of an animal population modeling according to human domestication needs. the current group of domesticated silver foxes are the result of nearly fifty years of experiments in the soviet union and russia to domesticate the silver morph of the red fox. this selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats, dogs, and other animals, such as pigmentation changes, floppy ears, and curly tails.[47] notably, the new foxes became more tame, allowing themselves to be petted, whimpering to get attention and sniffing and licking their caretakers.[48] in the united kingdom, a number of cases of non-fatal attacks on humans have been reported. they often involved children, or if there were gaps in homes through which foxes could pass.[49] foxes are among the comparatively few mammals which have been able to adapt themselves to a certain degree to living in urban (mostly suburban) human environments. their omnivorous diet allows them to survive on discarded food waste, and their skittish and often nocturnal nature means that they are often able to avoid detection, despite their larger size. urban foxes, however, have been identified as threats to cats and small dogs, and for this reason there is often pressure to exclude them from these environments.[50] the san joaquin kit fox is a highly endangered species that has, ironically, become adapted to urban living in the san joaquin valley and salinas valley of southern california. its diet includes mice, ground squirrels, rabbits, hares, bird eggs, and insects, and it has claimed habitats in open areas, golf courses, drainage basins, and school grounds.[50] the fox appears in many cultures, usually in folklore. however, there are slight variations in their depictions. in western and persian folklore, foxes are symbols of cunning and trickery—a reputation derived especially from their reputed ability to evade hunters. this is usually represented as a character possessing these traits. these traits are used on a wide variety of characters, either making them a nuisance to the story, a misunderstood hero, or a devious villain. in asian folklore, foxes are depicted as familiar spirits possessing magic powers. similar to in western folklore, foxes are portrayed as mischievous, usually tricking other people, with the ability to disguise as an attractive female human. however, there are other depictions of foxes as mystical, sacred creatures that can either bring wonder or ruin.[51] nine-tailed foxes appear in chinese folklore, literature, and mythology, in which, depending on the tale, they can be a good or a bad omen.[52] the motif was eventually introduced from chinese to japanese and korean cultures.[53] the constellation vulpecula represents a fox.[54] "
fish," fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. they form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. around 99% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging to the class actinopterygii, with over 95% belonging to the teleost subgrouping. the earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the cambrian period. although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. fish would continue to evolve through the paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. many fish of the paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators. the first fish with jaws appeared in the silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods. most fish are ectothermic (""cold-blooded""), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature.[1][2] fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of acoustic communication. acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. the production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.[3] the sounds emitted by fish can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved. they can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.[4] fish are abundant in most bodies of water. they can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., cusk-eels and snailfish), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of the ocean.[5] with 34,300 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.[6] fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially as food. commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (in aquaculture). they are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies. tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. however, traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). because in this manner the term ""fish"" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including tetrapods.[7][8] the traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. the word for fish in english and the other germanic languages (german fisch; gothic fisks) is inherited from proto-germanic, and is related to the latin piscis and old irish īasc, though the exact root is unknown; some authorities reconstruct an proto-indo-european root *peysk-, attested only in italic, celtic, and germanic.[9][10][11][12] the english word once had a much broader usage than its current biological meaning. names such as starfish, jellyfish, shellfish and cuttlefish attest to most any fully aquatic animal (including whales) once being 'fish'. ""correcting"" such names (e.g. to 'sea star') is an attempt to retroactively apply the current meaning of 'fish' to words that were coined when it had a different meaning. fish, as vertebrata, developed as sister of the tunicata. as the tetrapods emerged deep within the fishes group, as sister of the lungfish, characteristics of fish are typically shared by tetrapods, including having vertebrae and a cranium. early fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small, jawless, armored fish known as ostracoderms. jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. an extant clade, the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. the first jaws are found in placodermi fossils. they lacked distinct teeth, having instead the oral surfaces of their jaw plates modified to serve the various purposes of teeth. the diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth. it is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors. fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. the first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case. fish are a paraphyletic group: that is, any clade containing all fish also contains the tetrapods, which are not fish. for this reason, groups such as the class pisces seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal classifications. traditional classification divides fish into three extant classes, and with extinct forms sometimes classified within the tree, sometimes as their own classes:[14][15] the above scheme is the one most commonly encountered in non-specialist and general works. many of the above groups are paraphyletic, in that they have given rise to successive groups: agnathans are ancestral to chondrichthyes, who again have given rise to acanthodiians, the ancestors of osteichthyes. with the arrival of phylogenetic nomenclature, the fishes has been split up into a more detailed scheme, with the following major groups: † – indicates extinct taxonsome palaeontologists contend that because conodonta are chordates, they are primitive fish. for a fuller treatment of this taxonomy, see the vertebrate article. the position of hagfish in the phylum chordata is not settled. phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported the idea that the hagfish and the lampreys form a natural group, the cyclostomata, that is a sister group of the gnathostomata.[16][17] the various fish groups account for more than half of vertebrate species. there are almost 28,000 known extant species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with 970 sharks, rays, and chimeras and about 108 hagfish and lampreys.[18] a third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these families are cyprinidae, gobiidae, cichlidae, characidae, loricariidae, balitoridae, serranidae, labridae, and scorpaenidae. about 64 families are monotypic, containing only one species. the final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500.[19] agnatha (pacific hagfish) chondrichthyes (horn shark) actinopterygii (brown trout) sarcopterygii (coelacanth) the term ""fish"" most precisely describes any non-tetrapod craniate (i.e. an animal with a skull and in most cases a backbone) that has gills throughout life and whose limbs, if any, are in the shape of fins.[21] unlike groupings such as birds or mammals, fish are not a single clade but a paraphyletic collection of taxa, including hagfishes, lampreys, sharks and rays, ray-finned fish, coelacanths, and lungfish.[22][23] indeed, lungfish and coelacanths are closer relatives of tetrapods (such as mammals, birds, amphibians, etc.) than of other fish such as ray-finned fish or sharks, so the last common ancestor of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods. as paraphyletic groups are no longer recognised in modern systematic biology, the use of the term ""fish"" as a biological group must be avoided. many types of aquatic animals commonly referred to as ""fish"" are not fish in the sense given above; examples include shellfish, cuttlefish, starfish, crayfish and jellyfish. in earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction – sixteenth century natural historians classified also seals, whales, amphibians, crocodiles, even hippopotamuses, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.[24] however, according to the definition above, all mammals, including cetaceans like whales and dolphins, are not fish. in some contexts, especially in aquaculture, the true fish are referred to as finfish (or fin fish) to distinguish them from these other animals. a typical fish is ectothermic, has a streamlined body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has two sets of paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with scales, and lays eggs. each criterion has exceptions. tuna, swordfish, and some species of sharks show some warm-blooded adaptations – they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature.[22] streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as tuna, salmon, and jacks that can cover 10–20 body-lengths per second to species such as eels and rays that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second.[25] many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures. lungfish have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, gouramis have a structure called the labyrinth organ that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as corydoras extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach.[26] body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as seahorses, pufferfish, anglerfish, and gulpers. similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in moray eels), or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as placoid (typical of sharks and rays), cosmoid (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), ganoid (various fossil fish but also living gars and bichirs), cycloid, and ctenoid (these last two are found on most bony fish).[27] there are even fish that live mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water.[28] mudskippers feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows.[29] a single, undescribed species of phreatobius, has been called a true ""land fish"" as this worm-like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged leaf litter.[30][31] many species live in underground lakes, underground rivers or aquifers and are popularly known as cavefish.[32] fish range in size from the huge 16-metre (52 ft) whale shark to the tiny 8-millimetre (0.3 in) stout infantfish. fish species diversity is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and freshwater ecosystems. coral reefs in the indo-pacific constitute the center of diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the amazon, congo, and mekong basins. more than 5,600 fish species inhabit neotropical freshwaters alone, such that neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the earth. exceptionally rich sites in the amazon basin, such as cantão state park, can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of europe.[33] the deepest living fish in the ocean so far found is the mariana snailfish (pseudoliparis swirei) which lives at deeps of 8,000 meters (26,200 feet) along the mariana trench near guam.[34] most fish exchange gases using gills on either side of the pharynx. gills consist of threadlike structures called filaments. each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. in some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. the gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. however, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. this opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum. juvenile bichirs have external gills, a very primitive feature that they share with larval amphibians. fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended periods. amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days,[dubious – discuss] or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. the skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. the buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. catfish of the families loricariidae, callichthyidae, and scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts.[35] lungfish, with the exception of the australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). a number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. a few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the clariidae catfish family. breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. at the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns. air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. obligate air breathers, such as the african lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. facultative air breathers, such as the catfish hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.[35] fish have a closed-loop circulatory system. the heart pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body. in most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit.[36] the first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. the atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. the ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. the bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation. jaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food, including plants and other organisms. fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. in the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. the intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption. as with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. some of the wastes diffuse through the gills. blood wastes are filtered by the kidneys. saltwater fish tend to lose water because of osmosis. their kidneys return water to the body. the reverse happens in freshwater fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater. the scales of fish originate from the mesoderm (skin); they may be similar in structure to teeth. fish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal.[37] however, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.[38] fish brains are divided into several regions. at the front are the olfactory lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves.[37] the olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. in fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction.[37] together these structures form the forebrain. connecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram, this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). the diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis.[37] the pineal body lies just above the diencephalon. this structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.[37] the midbrain (or mesencephalon) contains the two optic lobes. these are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as rainbow trout and cichlids.[37] the hindbrain (or metencephalon) is particularly involved in swimming and balance.[37] the cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain.[37] hagfish and lampreys have relatively small cerebellae, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense.[37] the brain stem (or myelencephalon) is the brain's posterior.[37] as well as controlling some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem governs respiration and osmoregulation.[37] most fish possess highly developed sense organs. nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey.[39] some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the ampullae of lorenzini, electroreceptors that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt.[40] other fish, like the south american electric fishes gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication. fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination.[41] vision is an important sensory system for most species of fish. fish eyes are similar to those of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots.[42] fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment. hearing is an important sensory system for most species of fish. fish sense sound using their lateral lines and their ears. new research has expanded preconceptions about the cognitive capacities of fish. for example, manta rays have exhibited behavior linked to self-awareness in mirror test cases. placed in front of a mirror, individual rays engaged in contingency testing, that is, repetitive behavior aiming to check whether their reflection's behavior mimics their body movement.[43] wrasses have also passed the mirror test in a 2018 scientific study.[44][45] cases of tool use have also been noticed, notably in the choerodon family, in archerfish and atlantic cod.[46] experiments done by william tavolga provide evidence that fish have pain and fear responses. for instance, in tavolga's experiments, toadfish grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.[47] in 2003, scottish scientists at the university of edinburgh and the roslin institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with pain in other animals. bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do.[48][49] neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.[49] professor james d. rose of the university of wyoming claimed the study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess ""conscious awareness, particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours"".[50] rose argues that since fish brains are so different from human brains, fish are probably not conscious in the manner humans are, so that reactions similar to human reactions to pain instead have other causes. rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a neocortex.[51] however, animal behaviorist temple grandin argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because ""different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions.""[49] animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible suffering of fish caused by angling. some countries, such as germany have banned specific types of fishing, and the british rspca now formally prosecutes individuals who are cruel to fish.[52] in 2019, scientists have shown that members of the monogamous species amatitlania siquia exhibit pessimistic behavior when they are prevented from being with their partner.[53] most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone. these contractions form s-shaped curves that move down the body. as each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. the fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. the streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases. although most fish are exclusively ectothermic, there are exceptions. the only known bony fishes (infraclass teleostei) that exhibit endothermy are in the suborder scombroidei – which includes the billfishes, tunas, and the butterfly kingfish, a basal species of mackerel[54] – and also the opah. the opah, a lampriform, was demonstrated in 2015 to utilize ""whole-body endothermy"", generating heat with its swimming muscles to warm its body while countercurrent exchange (as in respiration) minimizes heat loss.[55] it is able to actively hunt prey such as squid and swim for long distances due to the ability to warm its entire body, including its heart,[56] which is a trait typically found in only mammals and birds (in the form of homeothermy). in the cartilaginous fishes (class chondrichthyes), sharks of the families lamnidae (porbeagle, mackerel, salmon, and great white sharks) and alopiidae (thresher sharks) exhibit endothermy. the degree of endothermy varies from the billfishes, which warm only their eyes and brain, to the bluefin tuna and the porbeagle shark, which maintain body temperatures in excess of 20 °c (68 °f) above ambient water temperatures.[54] endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous system processing, and higher rates of digestion. fish reproductive organs include testicles and ovaries. in most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused.[57] there may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness. in terms of spermatogonia distribution, the structure of teleosts testes has two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the seminiferous tubules, while in atherinomorph fish they are confined to the distal portion of these structures. fish can present cystic or semi-cystic spermatogenesis in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules lumen.[57] fish ovaries may be of three types: gymnovarian, secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian. in the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. in the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct.[58] gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct.[57] secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids and a few other teleosts. oogonia development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization processes. changes in the nucleus, ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.[57] postovulatory follicles are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not have endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. a degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. this process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.[57] some fish, like the california sheephead, are hermaphrodites, having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or, as in hamlets, have them simultaneously. over 97% of all known fish are oviparous,[59] that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. examples of oviparous fish include salmon, goldfish, cichlids, tuna, and eels. in the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their gametes into the surrounding water. however, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the horn shark, and oviparous rays, such as skates. in these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fins known as claspers. marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. the eggs have an average diameter of 1 millimetre (0.04 in). egg of lamprey egg of catshark (mermaids' purse) egg of bullhead shark egg of chimaera the newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called larvae. they are usually poorly formed, carry a large yolk sac (for nourishment), and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. the larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. during this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae. in ovoviviparous fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the yolk. each embryo develops in its own egg. familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include guppies, angel sharks, and coelacanths. some species of fish are viviparous. in such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply with that of the embryo. examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. this has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak nomorhamphus ebrardtii.[60] intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. this behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for nomorhamphus ebrardtii.[60] aquarists commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as livebearers. acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. the production of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour.[3] the sounds emitted can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved. fish can produce either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the swimbladder.[4] there are some species of fish that can produce sounds by rubbing or grinding their bones together. these noises produced by bone-on-bone interactions are known as 'stridulatory sounds'.[4] an example of this is seen in haemulon flavolineatum, a species commonly referred to as the 'french grunt fish', as it produces a grunting noise by grinding its teeth together.[4] this behaviour is most pronounced when the h. flavolineatum is in distress situations.[4] the grunts produced by this species of fishes generate a frequency of approximately 700 hz, and last approximately 47 milliseconds.[4] the h. flavolineatum does not emit sounds with frequencies greater than 1000 hz, and does not detect sounds that have frequencies greater than 1050 hz.[4] in a study conducted by oliveira et al. (2014), the longsnout seahorse, hippocampus reidi, was recorded producing two different categories of sounds; ‘clicks’ and ‘growls’. the sounds emitted by the h. reidi are accomplished by rubbing their coronet bone across the grooved section of their neurocranium.[61] ‘clicking’ sounds were found to be primarily produced during courtship and feeding, and the frequencies of clicks were within the range of 50 hz-800 hz.[62] the frequencies were noted to be on the higher end of the range during spawning periods, when the female and male fishes were less than fifteen centimeters apart.[62] growl sounds were produced when the h. reidi encountered stressful situations, such as handling by researchers.[62] the 'growl' sounds consist of a series of sound pulses and are emitted simultaneously with body vibrations.[62] some fish species create noise by engaging specialized muscles that contract and cause swimbladder vibrations. oyster toadfish produce loud grunting sounds by contracting muscles located along the sides of their swim bladder, known as sonic muscles [63] female and male toadfishes emit short-duration grunts, often as a fright response.[64] in addition to short-duration grunts, male toadfishes produce “boat whistle calls”.[65] these calls are longer in duration, lower in frequency, and are primarily used to attract mates.[65] the sounds emitted by the o. tao have frequency range of 140 hz to 260 hz.[65] the frequencies of the calls depend on the rate at which the sonic muscles contract.[66][63] the red drum, sciaenops ocellatus, produces drumming sounds by vibrating its swimbladder.[67] vibrations are caused by the rapid contraction of sonic muscles that surround the dorsal aspect of the swimbladder.[67] these vibrations result in repeated sounds with frequencies that range from 100 to >200 hz.[67] the s. ocellatus can produce different calls depending on the stimuli involved.[67] the sounds created in courtship situations are different from those made during distressing events such as predatorial attacks.[67] unlike the males of the s. ocellatus species, the females of this species don't produce sounds and lack sound-producing (sonic) muscles.[67] like other animals, fish suffer from diseases and parasites. to prevent disease they have a variety of defenses. non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. if pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response.[68] in recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.[69][70] some species use cleaner fish to remove external parasites. the best known of these are the bluestreak cleaner wrasses of the genus labroides found on coral reefs in the indian and pacific oceans. these small fish maintain so-called ""cleaning stations"" where other fish congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaners.[71] cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of fish groups, including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus, etroplus maculatus, the cleaner, and the much larger etroplus suratensis.[72] immune organs vary by type of fish.[73] in the jawless fish (lampreys and hagfish), true lymphoid organs are absent. these fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. for example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are produced in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and some areas of the gut (where granulocytes mature.) they resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish. cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system. they have three specialized organs that are unique to chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the leydig's organ within the walls of their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. these organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). they also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored. chondrostean fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the meninges (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, reticular cells and a small number of macrophages. the chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop. like chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many different immune cells.[74] in addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus.[75][76] in 2006, a lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) t cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.[77] b and t lymphocytes bearing immunoglobulins and t cell receptors, respectively, are found in all jawed fishes. indeed, the adaptive immune system as a whole evolved in an ancestor of all jawed vertebrate.[78] the 2006 iucn red list names 1,173 fish species that are threatened with extinction.[79] included are species such as atlantic cod,[80] devil's hole pupfish,[81] coelacanths,[82] and great white sharks.[83] because fish live underwater they are more difficult to study than terrestrial animals and plants, and information about fish populations is often lacking. however, freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small water bodies. for example, the devil's hole pupfish occupies only a single 3 by 6 metres (10 by 20 ft) pool.[84] overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such as cod and tuna.[85][86] overfishing eventually causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. such commercial extinction does not mean that the species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery. one well-studied example of fishery collapse is the pacific sardine sadinops sagax caerulues fishery off the california coast. from a 1937 peak of 790,000 long tons (800,000 t) the catch steadily declined to only 24,000 long tons (24,000 t) in 1968, after which the fishery was no longer economically viable.[87] the main tension between fisheries science and the fishing industry is that the two groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. in places such as scotland, newfoundland, and alaska the fishing industry is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it.[88][89] on the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.[90][91] a key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, the building of dams, removal of water for use by humans, and the introduction of exotic species.[92] an example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon, a north american freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.[93] introduction of non-native species has occurred in many habitats. one of the best studied examples is the introduction of nile perch into lake victoria in the 1960s. nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct.[94] carp, snakeheads,[95] tilapia, european perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments. throughout history, humans have utilized fish as a food source. historically and today, most fish protein has come by means of catching wild fish. however, aquaculture, or fish farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 bce. in china,[96] is becoming increasingly important in many nations. overall, about one-sixth of the world's protein is estimated to be provided by fish.[97] that proportion is considerably elevated in some developing nations and regions heavily dependent on the sea. in a similar manner, fish have been tied to trade. catching fish for the purpose of food or sport is known as fishing, while the organized effort by humans to catch fish is called a fishery. fisheries are a huge global business and provide income for millions of people.[97] the annual yield from all fisheries worldwide is about 154 million tons,[98] with popular species including herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, and salmon. however, the term fishery is broadly applied, and includes more organisms than just fish, such as mollusks and crustaceans, which are often called ""fish"" when used as food. fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in cave art, being raised as ornamental fish in ponds, and displayed in aquariums in homes, offices, or public settings. recreational fishing is fishing primarily for pleasure or competition; it can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is fishing for profit, or subsistence fishing, which is fishing primarily for food. the most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks, and any one of a wide range of baits. recreational fishing is particularly popular in north america and europe and state, provincial, and federal government agencies actively management target fish species.[99][100] angling is a method of fishing, specifically the practice of catching fish by means of an ""angle"" (hook). anglers must select the right hook, cast accurately, and retrieve at the right speed while considering water and weather conditions, species, fish response, time of the day, and other factors. fish themes have symbolic significance in many religions. in ancient mesopotamia, fish offerings were made to the gods from the very earliest times.[101] fish were also a major symbol of enki, the god of water.[101] fish frequently appear as filling motifs in cylinder seals from the old babylonian (c. 1830 bc – c. 1531 bc) and neo-assyrian (911–609 bc) periods.[101] starting during the kassite period (c. 1600 bc – c. 1155 bc) and lasting until the early persian period (550–30 bc), healers and exorcists dressed in ritual garb resembling the bodies of fish.[101] during the seleucid period (312–63 bc), the legendary babylonian culture hero oannes, described by berossus, was said to have dressed in the skin of a fish.[101] fish were sacred to the syrian goddess atargatis[102] and, during her festivals, only her priests were permitted to eat them.[102] in the book of jonah, a work of jewish literature probably written in the fourth century bc, the central figure, a prophet named jonah, is swallowed by a giant fish after being thrown overboard by the crew of the ship he is travelling on.[104][105][106] the fish later vomits jonah out on shore after three days.[104][105][106] this book was later included as part of the hebrew bible, or christian old testament,[107][108] and a version of the story it contains is summarized in surah 37:139-148 of the quran.[109] early christians used the ichthys, a symbol of a fish, to represent jesus,[102][103] because the greek word for fish, ιχθυς ichthys, could be used as an acronym for ""ίησοῦς χριστός, θεοῦ υἱός, σωτήρ"" (iesous christos, theou huios, soter), meaning ""jesus christ, son of god, saviour"".[102][103] the gospels also refer to ""fishers of men""[110] and feeding the multitude. in the dhamma of buddhism, the fish symbolize happiness as they have complete freedom of movement in the water. often drawn in the form of carp which are regarded in the orient as sacred on account of their elegant beauty, size and life-span. among the deities said to take the form of a fish are ika-roa of the polynesians, dagon of various ancient semitic peoples, the shark-gods of hawaiʻi and matsya of the hindus. the astrological symbol pisces is based on a constellation of the same name, but there is also a second fish constellation in the night sky, piscis austrinus.[111] fish feature prominently in art and literature, in movies such as finding nemo and books such as the old man and the sea. large fish, particularly sharks, have frequently been the subject of horror movies and thrillers, most notably the novel jaws, which spawned a series of films of the same name that in turn inspired similar films or parodies such as shark tale and snakehead terror. piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as piranha; however, contrary to popular belief, the red-bellied piranha is actually a generally timid scavenger species that is unlikely to harm humans.[112] legends of half-human, half-fish mermaids have featured in folklore, including the stories of hans christian andersen. though often used interchangeably, in biology these words have different meanings. fish is used as a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. fishes is used to describe different species or species groups.[113][114][115] thus a pond would be said to contain 120 fish if all were from a single species or 120 fishes if these included a mix of several species. the distinction is similar to that between people and peoples. a random assemblage of fish merely using some localised resource such as food or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. when fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending on the degree of organisation. a shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the other members of the group. schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.[117] examples: while the words ""school"" and ""shoal"" have different meanings within biology, the distinctions are often ignored by non-specialists who treat the words as synonyms. thus speakers of british english commonly use ""shoal"" to describe any grouping of fish, and speakers of american english commonly use ""school"" just as loosely.[118] "
cat," the cat (felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] it is the only domesticated species in the family felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] a cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. about 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6] the cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk, the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. it can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] it secretes and perceives pheromones.[8] female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.[9] domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, and evoking population control.[10] cats were first domesticated in the near east around 7500 bc.[11] it was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in ancient egypt, as since around 3100 bc veneration was given to cats in ancient egypt.[12][13] as of 2017[update], the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the united states, with 95 million cats owned.[14][15][16] in the united kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019[update].[17] the origin of the english word 'cat', old english catt, is thought to be the late latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[18] it was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived from an egyptian precursor of coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, ""tomcat"", or its feminine form suffixed with -t.[19] the late latin word may be derived from another afro-asiatic[20] or nilo-saharan language. the nubian word kaddîska ""wildcat"" and nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[21] the nubian word may be a loan from arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ. it is ""equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient germanic word, imported into latin and thence to greek and to syriac and arabic"".[22] the word may be derived from germanic and northern european languages, and ultimately be borrowed from uralic, cf. northern sami gáđfi, ""female stoat"", and hungarian hölgy, ""stoat""; from proto-uralic *käďwä, ""female (of a furred animal)"".[23] the english puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from dutch poes or from low german puuskatte, related to swedish kattepus, or norwegian pus, pusekatt. similar forms exist in lithuanian puižė and irish puisín or puiscín. the etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.[24][25] a male cat is called a tom or tomcat[26] (or a gib,[27] if neutered). an unspayed female is called a queen,[28] especially in a cat-breeding context. a juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. in early modern english, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[29] a group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.[30] the scientific name felis catus was proposed by carl linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat.[1][2] felis catus domesticus was proposed by johann christian polycarp erxleben in 1777.[3] felis daemon proposed by konstantin alekseevich satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.[31][32] in 2003, the international commission on zoological nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species, namely felis catus.[33][34] in 2007, it was considered a subspecies, f. silvestris catus, of the european wildcat (f. silvestris) following results of phylogenetic research.[35][36] in 2017, the iucn cat classification taskforce followed the recommendation of the iczn in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species, felis catus.[37] the domestic cat is a member of the felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15 million years ago.[38] the genus felis diverged from the felidae around 6–7 million years ago.[39] results of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[40] the domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid like all mammals and both possess 38 chromosomes[41] and roughly 20,000 genes.[42] the leopard cat (prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in china around 5500 bc. this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.[43] the earliest known indication for the taming of an african wildcat (f. lybica) was excavated close by a human neolithic grave in shillourokambos, southern cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 bc. since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on cyprus, the inhabitants of this neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the middle eastern mainland.[44] scientists therefore assume that african wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the fertile crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (mus musculus), and were tamed by neolithic farmers. this commensal relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. as agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.[11][6] wildcats of egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.[45] the earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in greece dates to around 1200 bc. greek, phoenician, carthaginian and etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern europe.[46] during the roman empire they were introduced to corsica and sardinia before the beginning of the 1st millennium.[47] by the 5th century bc, they were familiar animals around settlements in magna graecia and etruria.[48] by the end of the roman empire in the 5th century, the egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a baltic sea port in northern germany.[45] during domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild. several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets. these traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. captive leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans, but were not domesticated.[49] house cats often mate with feral cats,[50] producing hybrids such as the kellas cat in scotland.[51] hybridisation between domestic and other felinae species is also possible.[52] development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century.[53] an analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds.[54] most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats. genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.[55] the domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the european wildcat.[56] it averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. males are larger than females.[57] adult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 11 lb).[40] cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).[58]:11 the extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.[58]:16 unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.[59] the cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.[60]:35 within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. when it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and death.[61] compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.[61] the premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors. these are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively, and cats are largely incapable of mastication.[60]:37 although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar, they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection.[62] the cat is digitigrade. it walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.[63] unlike most mammals, it uses a ""pacing"" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. it registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. this also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. as it speeds up walking to trotting, its gait changes to a ""diagonal"" gait: the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.[64] cats have protractable and retractable claws.[65] in their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. this keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. the claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet.[66] cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. they may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.[67] most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. the dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. more proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth ""finger"". this special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (“polydactyly”).[68] polydactylous cats occur along north america's northeast coast and in great britain.[69] cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.[60]:43 this is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.[70] large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. the domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration.[71] at low light, a cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.[72] however, the domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited.[73] a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone. however, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision.[74] the domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 hz to 32 khz.[75] it can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 hz to 79,000 hz. it can hear a range of 10.5 octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.[76][77] its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae, which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise. it can detect ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey.[78][79] cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa, about 5.8 square centimetres (29⁄32 square inch) in area, which is about twice that of humans.[80] cats and many other animals have a jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening. it allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot. cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol,[81] which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands.[82] many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion.[83] about 70–80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone.[84] this response is also produced by other plants, such as silver vine (actinidia polygama) and the herb valerian; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats' social or sexual behaviors.[85] cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue).[86] domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness.[87] their taste buds instead respond to acids, amino acids like protein, and bitter tastes.[88] cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around 38 °c (100 °f) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the ""prey"" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).[86] to aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces. these provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.[60]:47 most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for sitting in high places, or perching. a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch. another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. a cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its paws.[89] during a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. this reflex is known as the cat righting reflex.[90] a cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls of 90 cm (2 ft 11 in) or more.[91] how cats are able to right themselves when falling has been investigated as the ""falling cat problem"". outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night.[92] domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes, but can range many hundreds of meters from this central point. they establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres).[93] the timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied, which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening, as a response to greater human activity at these times.[94] cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. the daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. the term ""cat nap"" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. while asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.[95] the social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females.[96][97] within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others.[98] each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. these territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation.[82] between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling and, if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. despite this colonial organization, cats do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.[99] life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. ethologically, the human keeper of a cat functions as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother.[100] adult cats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. their high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly difficult for humans to ignore.[101] however, some pet cats are poorly socialized. in particular, older cats show aggressiveness towards newly arrived kittens, which include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.[102] domestic cats' scent rubbing behavior towards humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means for social bonding.[103] domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.[7] their body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. the tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats. a raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones.[104] feral cats are generally silent.[105]:208 nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.[97] purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signalling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens. post-nursing cats often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed,[106][107] or eating. the mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. the cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound.[108] cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean.[109] the cat's tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500 μm long, which are called papillae. these contain keratin which makes them rigid[110] so the papillae act like a hairbrush. some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming. these clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped and about 2–3 cm (3⁄4–1 1⁄4 in) long. hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut, as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush.[109] among domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females.[111] among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female. in such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male.[112] another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home.[111] female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.[113] when cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting.[114] often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. they may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.[115] serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. however, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. in addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus.[116] sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose.[117] the shape and structure of cats' cheeks is insufficient to suck. they lap with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouths. lapping at a rate of four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water, and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew, drawing water upwards.[118][119] feral cats and free-fed house cats consume several small meals in a day. the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. they select food based on its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. cats reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past.[99][120] they also avoid sweet food and milk. most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea.[121] some also develop odd eating habits and like to eat or chew on things like wool, plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. this condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.[122] cats hunt small prey, primarily birds and rodents,[123] and are often used as a form of pest control.[124][125] cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured.[126] the strategy used depends on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.[127]:153 domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the united states, killing an estimated 1.4 to 3.7 billion birds and 6.9 to 20.7 billion mammals annually.[128] certain species appear more susceptible than others; for example, 30% of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat.[129] in the recovery of ringed robins (erithacus rubecula) and dunnocks (prunella modularis), 31% of deaths were a result of cat predation.[130] in parts of north america, the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety.[131] perhaps the best-known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to ""play"" with prey by releasing it after capture. this cat and mouse behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.[132] another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. one explanation is that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy, in which humans are reacted to as if they are at, or near, the top.[133] another explanation is that they attempt to teach their guardians to hunt or to help their human as if feeding ""an elderly cat, or an inept kitten"".[134] this hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home prey, despite males having negligible involvement in raising kittens.[127]:153 on islands, birds can contribute as much as 60% of a cat's diet.[135] in nearly all cases, however, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a ""mesopredator release"" effect;[136] where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey. domestic cats are, however, known to be a contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction. the south island piopio, chatham rail,[130] and the new zealand merganser[137] are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery.[138][139] one feral cat in new zealand killed 102 new zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven days.[140] in the us, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3 – 22.3 billion mammals annually.[128] in australia, the impact of cats on mammal populations is even greater than the impact of habitat loss.[141] more than one million reptiles are killed by feral cats each day, representing 258 species.[142] cats have contributed to the extinction of the navassa curly-tailed lizard and chioninia coctei.[143] domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play. this behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey.[144] cats also engage in play fighting, with each other and with humans. this behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.[145] cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry.[146] owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest. they become habituated to a toy they have played with before.[147] string is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cat's tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death.[148] owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer's dot, which cats may chase.[149] female cats called queens are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days. they are usually ready to mate between early february and august.[150] several males, called tomcats, are attracted to a female in heat. they fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. at first, the female rejects the male, but eventually, the female allows the male to mate. the female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backward-pointing penile spines, which are about 1 mm (1⁄32 in) long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines may provide the female with increased sexual stimulation, which acts to induce ovulation.[151] after mating, the female cleans her vulva thoroughly. if a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female attacks him. after about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.[152] because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate.[153] furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.[152] the morula forms 124 hours after conception. at 148 hours, early blastocysts form. at 10–12 days, implantation occurs.[154] the gestation of queens lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 65 days.[150][155] data on the reproductive capacity of more than 2,300 free-ranging queens were collected during a study between may 1998 and october 2000. they had one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittens. they produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents.[9] the first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 months. this varies depending on breed.[152] kittens reach puberty at the age of 9–10 months.[150] cats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother.[156] they can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproduction.[157] this surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before puberty, at about three to six months.[158] in the united states, about 80% of household cats are neutered.[159] the average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. in the early 1980s, it was about seven years,[160]:33[161] rising to 9.4 years in 1995[160]:33 and 15.1 years in 2018.[162] some cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s,[163] with the oldest known cat, creme puff, dying at a verified age of 38.[164] spaying or neutering increases life expectancy: one study found neutered male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females.[160]:35 having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.[165] despite widespread concern about the welfare of free-roaming cats, the lifespans of neutered feral cats in managed colonies compare favorably with those of pet cats.[166]:45[167]:1358[168][169][170][171] about two hundred fifty heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many similar to human inborn errors of metabolism.[172] the high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases.[173][174] diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations, injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and arthritis. vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.[175] the domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world.[55] it is adaptable and now present on all continents except antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands—even on isolated islands such as the kerguelen islands.[176][177] due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species.[178] as it is little altered from the wildcat, it can readily interbreed with the wildcat. this hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in scotland and hungary and possibly also the iberian peninsula.[52] it lives on small islands with no human inhabitants.[179] feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.[180] feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. they are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas.[10] the numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the united states feral population range from twenty-five to sixty million.[10] feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large colonies, which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.[181] famous feral cat colonies are found in rome around the colosseum and forum romanum, with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.[182] public attitudes towards feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to regarding them as vermin.[183] one common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed ""trap-neuter-return"", where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against diseases such as rabies and the feline panleukopenia and leukemia viruses, and then released.[184] before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.[181] some feral cats can be successfully socialised and 're-tamed' for adoption; young cats, especially kittens[185] and cats that have had prior experience and contact with humans are the most receptive to these efforts. cats are common pets throughout the world, and their worldwide population as of 2007 exceeded 500 million.[186] cats have been used for millennia to control rodents, notably around grain stores and aboard ships, and both uses extend to the present day.[187][188] as well as being kept as pets, cats are also used in the international fur[189] and leather industries for making coats, hats, blankets, and stuffed toys;[190] and shoes, gloves, and musical instruments respectively[191] (about 24 cats are needed to make a cat-fur coat).[192] this use has been outlawed in the united states, australia, and the european union in 2007.[193] cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft,[194] and are still made into blankets in switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism.[195] in the western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the schrödinger's cat thought experiment. a few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years, both through associations or national and international organizations (such as the canadian federation of humane societies's one[196]) and over the internet,[197][198] but such a task does not seem simple to achieve. general estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million.[199][200][201][202][203] walter chandoha made his career photographing cats after his 1949 images of loco, an especially charming stray taken in, were published around the world. he is reported to have photographed 90,000 cats during his career and maintained an archive of 225,000 images that he drew from for publications during his lifetime.[204] a cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat-registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard.[205][206] both pedigreed and non-purebred companion (""moggy"") cats are admissible, although the rules differ from organization to organization. competing cats are compared to the applicable breed standard,[207] and assessed for temperament and apparent health; the owners of those judged to be most ideal awarded a prize. moggies are judged based on their temperament and healthy appearance. some events also include activity judging, such as trained navigation of obstacle course. often, at the end of the year, all of the points accrued at various shows are added up and more national and regional titles are awarded to champion cats. cats can be infected or infested with viruses, bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans.[208] in some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease,[209] however, the same disease can then become evident in a human. the likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person. humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected, however, those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat's body.[208][210] some of the infections of most concern include salmonella, cat-scratch disease and toxoplasmosis.[209] in ancient egypt, cats were worshipped, and the goddess bastet often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. the greek historian herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. families took their dead cats to the sacred city of bubastis, where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories. herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats.[211] ancient greeks and romans kept weasels as pets, which were seen as the ideal rodent-killers. the earliest unmistakable evidence of the greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from magna graecia dating to the mid-fifth century bc showing iokastos and phalanthos, the legendary founders of rhegion and taras respectively, playing with their pet cats. the usual ancient greek word for 'cat' was ailouros, meaning 'thing with the waving tail'. cats are rarely mentioned in ancient greek literature. aristotle remarked in his history of animals that ""female cats are naturally lecherous."" the greeks later syncretized their own goddess artemis with the egyptian goddess bastet, adopting bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to artemis. in ovid's metamorphoses, when the deities flee to egypt and take animal forms, the goddess diana turns into a cat.[212][213] cats eventually displaced ferrets as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of mice. during the middle ages, many of artemis's associations with cats were grafted onto the virgin mary. cats are often shown in icons of annunciation and of the holy family and, according to italian folklore, on the same night that mary gave birth to jesus, a cat in bethlehem gave birth to a kitten.[214] domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the age of discovery, as ships' cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.[46] several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. in japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune.[215] in norse mythology, freyja, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.[216] in jewish legend, the first cat was living in the house of the first man adam as a pet that got rid of mice. the cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animals. it is also written that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while every other animal has an incarnation species in the water.[217] although no species are sacred in islam, cats are revered by muslims. some western writers have stated muhammad had a favorite cat, muezza.[218] he is reported to have loved cats so much, ""he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it"".[219] the story has no origin in early muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later sufi saint, ahmed ar-rifa'i, centuries after muhammad.[220] one of the companions of muhammad was known as abu hurayrah (""father of the kitten""), in reference to his documented affection to cats.[221] many cultures have negative superstitions about cats. an example would be the belief that a black cat ""crossing one's path"" leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiars used to augment a witch's powers and skills. the killing of cats in medieval ypres, belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day kattenstoet (cat parade).[222] in mid-16th century france, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. according to norman davies, the assembled people ""shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized"".[223] james frazer wrote that ""it was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a fox was burned. the people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. the french kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. in 1648 louis xiv, crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. but this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in paris. at metz midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. similarly at gap, in the department of the hautes-alpes, cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.""[224] according to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. in many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in italy, germany, greece, brazil and some spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives,[225][226] while in turkish and arabic traditions, the number of lives is six.[227] the myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations.[citation needed] also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.[228] "
goat," capra hircus linnaeus, 1758 capra depressa linnaeus, 1758 capra mambrica linnaeus, 1758 capra reversa linnaeus, 1758 the domestic goat or simply goat (capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of c. aegagrus domesticated from the wild goat of southwest asia and eastern europe. the goat is a member of the animal family bovidae and the subfamily caprinae, meaning it is closely related to the sheep. there are over 300 distinct breeds of goat.[1] it is one of the oldest domesticated species of animal, according to archaeological evidence that its earliest domestication occurred in iran at 10,000 calibrated calendar years ago.[2] goats have been used for milk, meat, fur, and skins across much of the world.[3] milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese. female goats are referred to as does or nannies, intact males are called bucks or billies, and juvenile goats of both sexes are called kids. castrated males are called wethers. while the words hircine and caprine both refer to anything having a goat-like quality, hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goats. in 2011, there were more than 924 million goats living in the world, according to the un food and agriculture organization.[4] the modern english word goat comes from old english gāt ""she-goat, goat in general"", which in turn derives from proto-germanic *gaitaz (cf. norwegian/icelandic geit, german geiß, and gothic gaits), ultimately from proto-indo-european *ǵʰaidos meaning ""young goat"" (cf. latin haedus ""kid""),[5] itself perhaps from a root meaning ""jump"" (assuming that old church slavonic zajęcǐ ""hare"", sanskrit jihīte ""he moves"" are related).[citation needed] to refer to the male, old english used bucca (giving modern buck) until ousted by hegote, hegoote in the late 12th century. nanny goat (females) originated in the 18th century, and billy goat (for males) originated in the 19th century. goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans.[6] the most recent genetic analysis[7] confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild bezoar ibex of the zagros mountains is the likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goats today.[6] neolithic farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to milk and meat, as well as to their dung, which was used as fuel; and their bones, hair, and sinew were used for clothing, building, and tools.[1] the earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 years before present are found in ganj dareh in iran. goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in jericho, choga mami,[8] djeitun, and çayönü, dating the domestication of goats in western asia at between 8,000 and 9,000 years ago.[6] studies of dna evidence suggests 10,000 years bp as the domestication date.[7] historically, goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. it has also been used to produce parchment. each recognized breed of goat has specific weight ranges, which vary from over 140 kg (300 lb) for bucks of larger breeds such as the boer, to 20 to 27 kg (45 to 60 lb) for smaller goat does.[9] within each breed, different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes. at the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the african pygmy, which stand 41 to 58 cm (16 to 23 in) at the shoulder as adults.[10] most goats naturally have two horns, of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed.[11] there have been incidents of polycerate goats (having as many as eight horns), although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited. unlike cattle, goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled, as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked. breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring, which are typically sterile.[11] their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins, and are used for defense, dominance, and territoriality.[12] goats are ruminants. they have a four-chambered stomach consisting of the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum. as with other mammal ruminants, they are even-toed ungulates. the females have an udder consisting of two teats, in contrast to cattle, which have four teats.[13] an exception to this is the boer goat, which sometimes may have up to eight teats.[14][15] goats have horizontal, slit-shaped pupils. because goats' irises are usually pale, their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle, deer, most horses, and many sheep, whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and sclera. both male and female goats have beards, and many types of goat (most commonly dairy goats, dairy-cross boers, and pygmy goats) may have wattles, one dangling from each side of the neck.[16] goats expressing the tan pattern have coats pigmented completely with phaeomelanin (tan/brown pigment). the allele which codes for this pattern is located at the agouti locus of the goat genome. it is completely dominant to all other alleles at this locus. there are multiple modifier genes which control how much tan pigment is actually expressed, so a tan-patterned goat can have a coat ranging from pure white to deep red. goats reach puberty between three and 15 months of age, depending on breed and nutritional status. many breeders prefer to postpone breeding until the doe has reached 70% of the adult weight. however, this separation is rarely possible in extensively managed, open-range herds.[17] in temperate climates and among the swiss breeds, the breeding season commences as the day length shortens, and ends in early spring or before. in equatorial regions, goats are able to breed at any time of the year. successful breeding in these regions depends more on available forage than on day length. does of any breed or region come into estrus (heat) every 21 days for two to 48 hours. a doe in heat typically flags (vigorously wags) her tail often, stays near the buck if one is present, becomes more vocal, and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat. bucks (intact males) of swiss and northern breeds come into rut in the fall as with the does' heat cycles. bucks of equatorial breeds may show seasonal reduced fertility, but as with the does, are capable of breeding at all times. rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite and obsessive interest in the does.[12] a buck in rut will display flehmen lip curling and will urinate on his forelegs and face.[18] sebaceous scent glands at the base of the horns add to the male goat's odor, which is important to make him attractive to the female. some does will not mate with a buck which has been descented.[12] in addition to natural, traditional mating, artificial insemination has gained popularity among goat breeders, as it allows easy access to a wide variety of bloodlines. gestation length is approximately 150 days. twins are the usual result, with single and triplet births also common. less frequent are litters of quadruplet, quintuplet, and even sextuplet kids. birthing, known as kidding, generally occurs uneventfully. just before kidding, the doe will have a sunken area around the tail and hip, as well as heavy breathing. she may have a worried look, become restless and display great affection for her keeper. the mother often eats the placenta, which gives her much-needed nutrients, helps stanch her bleeding, and parallels the behavior of wild herbivores, such as deer, to reduce the lure of the birth scent for predators.[19][20] freshening (coming into milk production) occurs at kidding. milk production varies with the breed, age, quality, and diet of the doe; dairy goats generally produce between 680 and 1,810 kg (1,500 and 4,000 lb) of milk per 305-day lactation. on average, a good quality dairy doe will give at least 3 kg (6 lb) of milk per day while she is in milk. a first-time milker may produce less, or as much as 7 kg (16 lb), or more of milk in exceptional cases. after the lactation, the doe will ""dry off"", typically after she has been bred. occasionally, goats that have not been bred and are continuously milked will continue lactation beyond the typical 305 days.[21] meat, fiber, and pet breeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids until weaning. male lactation is also known to occur in goats.[22] goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything, including tin cans and cardboard boxes. while goats will not actually eat inedible material, they are browsing animals, not grazers like cattle and sheep, and (coupled with their highly curious nature) will chew on and taste just about anything remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat, including cardboard, clothing and paper (such as labels from tin cans).[23] the unusual smells of leftover food in discarded cans or boxes may further stimulate their curiosity.[citation needed] aside from sampling many things, goats are quite particular in what they actually consume, preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees, as well as the occasional broad-leaved plant. however, it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied, and includes some species which are otherwise toxic.[24] they will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing starvation. this is one reason goat-rearing is most often free-ranging, since stall-fed goat-rearing involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable. goats prefer to browse on vines, such as kudzu, on shrubbery and on weeds, more like deer than sheep, preferring them to grasses. nightshade is poisonous; wilted fruit tree leaves can also kill goats. silage (fermented corn stalks) and haylage (fermented grass hay) can be used if consumed immediately after opening – goats are particularly sensitive to listeria bacteria that can grow in fermented feeds. alfalfa, a high-protein plant, is widely fed as hay; fescue is the least palatable and least nutritious hay. mold in a goat's feed can make it sick and possibly kill it. in various places in china, goats are used in the production of tea. goats are released onto the tea terraces where they avoid consuming the green tea leaves (which contain bitter tasting substances) but instead eat the weeds. the goats' droppings fertilise the tea plants.[25] the digestive physiology of a very young kid (like the young of other ruminants) is essentially the same as that of a monogastric animal. milk digestion begins in the abomasum, the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling. at birth, the rumen is undeveloped, but as the kid begins to consume solid feed, the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients. the adult size of a particular goat is a product of its breed (genetic potential) and its diet while growing (nutritional potential). as with all livestock, increased protein diets (10 to 14%) and sufficient calories during the prepuberty period yield higher growth rates and larger eventual size than lower protein rates and limited calories.[26] large-framed goats, with a greater skeletal size, reach mature weight at a later age (36 to 42 months) than small-framed goats (18 to 24 months) if both are fed to their full potential. large-framed goats need more calories than small-framed goats for maintenance of daily functions.[27] goats are naturally curious. they are also agile and well known for their ability to climb and balance in precarious places. this makes them the only ruminant to regularly climb trees. due to their agility and inquisitiveness, they are notorious for escaping their pens by testing fences and enclosures, either intentionally or simply because they are used to climbing. if any of the fencing can be overcome, goats will almost inevitably escape. goats have been found to be as intelligent as dogs by some studies.[28] when handled as a group, goats tend to display less herding behavior than sheep. when grazing undisturbed, they tend to spread across the field or range, rather than feed side by side as do sheep. when nursing young, goats will leave their kids separated (""lying out"") rather than clumped, as do sheep. they will generally turn and face an intruder and bucks are more likely to charge or butt at humans than are rams.[29] a study by queen mary university reports that goats try to communicate with people in the same manner as domesticated animals such as dogs and horses. goats were first domesticated as livestock more than 10,000 years ago. research conducted to test communication skills found that the goats will look to a human for assistance when faced with a challenge that had previously been mastered, but was then modified. specifically, when presented with a box, the goat was able to remove the lid and retrieve a treat inside, but when the box was turned so the lid could not be removed, the goat would turn and gaze at the person and move toward them, before looking back toward the box. this is the same type of complex communication observed by animals bred as domestic pets, such as dogs. researchers believe that better understanding of human-goat interaction could offer overall improvement in the animals' welfare.[30][31] the field of anthrozoology has established that domesticated animals have the capacity for complex communication with humans when in 2015 a japanese scientist determined that levels of oxytocin did increase in human subjects when dogs were exposed to a dose of the ""love hormone"", proving that a human-animal bond does exist. this is the same affinity that was proven with the london study above; goats are intelligent, capable of complex communication, and able to form bonds.[32] while goats are generally considered hardy animals and in many situations receive little medical care, they are subject to a number of diseases. among the conditions affecting goats are respiratory diseases including pneumonia, foot rot, internal parasites, pregnancy toxosis, and feed toxicity. feed toxicity can vary based on breed and location. certain foreign fruits and vegetables can be toxic to different breeds of goats. goats can become infected with various viral and bacterial diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, caprine arthritis encephalitis, caseous lymphadenitis, pinkeye, mastitis, and pseudorabies. they can transmit a number of zoonotic diseases to people, such as tuberculosis, brucellosis, q-fever, and rabies.[33] life expectancy for goats is between 15 and 18 years.[34] an instance of a goat reaching the age of 24 has been reported.[35] several factors can reduce this average expectancy; problems during kidding can lower a doe's expected life span to 10 or 11, and stresses of going into rut can lower a buck's expected life span to eight to 10 years.[35] a goat is useful to humans when it is living and when it is dead, first as a renewable provider of milk, manure, and fiber, and then as meat and hide.[36] some charities provide goats to impoverished people in poor countries, because goats are easier and cheaper to manage than cattle, and have multiple uses. in addition, goats are used for driving and packing purposes. the intestine of goats is used to make ""catgut"", which is still in use as a material for internal human surgical sutures and strings for musical instruments. the horn of the goat, which signifies plenty and wellbeing (the cornucopia), is also used to make spoons.[37] according to the food and agriculture organization (fao), the top producers of goat milk in 2008 were india (4 million metric tons), bangladesh (2.16 million metric tons), and the sudan (1.47 million metric tons).[38] india slaughters 41% of 124.4 million goats each year. the 0.6 million metric tonnes of goat meat make up 8% of india's annual meat production.[39] approximately 440 million goats are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.[40] husbandry, or animal care and use, varies by region and culture. the particular housing used for goats depends not only on the intended use of the goat, but also on the region of the world where they are raised. historically, domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. these methods of herding are still used today. in some parts of the world, especially europe and north america, distinct breeds of goats are kept for dairy (milk) and for meat production. excess male kids of dairy breeds are typically slaughtered for meat. both does and bucks of meat breeds may be slaughtered for meat, as well as older animals of any breed. the meat of older bucks (more than one year old) is generally considered not desirable for meat for human consumption. castration at a young age prevents the development of typical buck odor. dairy goats are generally pastured in summer and may be stabled during the winter. as dairy does are milked daily, they are generally kept close to the milking shed. their grazing is typically supplemented with hay and concentrates. stabled goats may be kept in stalls similar to horses, or in larger group pens. in the us system, does are generally rebred annually. in some european commercial dairy systems, the does are bred only twice, and are milked continuously for several years after the second kidding. meat goats are more frequently pastured year-round, and may be kept many miles from barns. angora and other fiber breeds are also kept on pasture or range. range-kept and pastured goats may be supplemented with hay or concentrates, most frequently during the winter or dry seasons. in the indian subcontinent and much of asia, goats are kept largely for milk production, both in commercial and household settings. the goats in this area may be kept closely housed or may be allowed to range for fodder. the salem black goat is herded to pasture in fields and along roads during the day, but is kept penned at night for safe-keeping.[41] in africa and the mideast, goats are typically run in flocks with sheep. this maximizes the production per acre, as goats and sheep prefer different food plants. multiple types of goat-raising are found in ethiopia, where four main types have been identified: pastured in annual crop systems, in perennial crop systems, with cattle, and in arid areas, under pastoral (nomadic) herding systems. in all four systems, however, goats were typically kept in extensive systems, with few purchased inputs.[42] household goats are traditionally kept in nigeria. while many goats are allowed to wander the homestead or village, others are kept penned and fed in what is called a 'cut-and-carry' system. this type of husbandry is also used in parts of latin america. cut-and-carry, which refers to the practice of cutting down grasses, corn or cane for feed rather than allowing the animal access to the field, is particularly suited for types of feed, such as corn or cane, that are easily destroyed by trampling.[43] pet goats may be found in many parts of the world when a family keeps one or more animals for emotional reasons rather than as production animals. it is becoming more common for goats to be kept exclusively as pets in north america and europe. the taste of goat kid meat is similar to that of spring lamb meat;[44] in fact, in the english-speaking islands of the caribbean, and in some parts of asia, particularly bangladesh, pakistan, and india, the word “mutton” is used to describe both goat and sheep meat. however, some compare the taste of goat meat to veal or venison, depending on the age and condition of the goat. its flavor is said to be primarily linked to the presence of 4-methyloctanoic and 4-methylnonanoic acid.[45] it can be prepared in a variety of ways, including stewing, baking, grilling, barbecuing, canning, and frying; it can be minced, curried, or made into sausage. due to its low fat content, the meat can toughen at high temperatures if cooked without additional moisture. one of the most popular goats grown for meat is the south african boer, introduced into the united states in the early 1990s. the new zealand kiko is also considered a meat breed, as is the myotonic or ""fainting goat"", a breed originating in tennessee. goats produce about 2% of the world's total annual milk supply.[46] some goats are bred specifically for milk. if the strong-smelling buck is not separated from the does, his scent will affect the milk. goat milk naturally has small, well-emulsified fat globules, which means the cream remains suspended in the milk, instead of rising to the top, as in raw cow milk; therefore, it does not need to be homogenized. indeed, if the milk is to be used to make cheese, homogenization is not recommended, as this changes the structure of the milk, affecting the culture's ability to coagulate the milk and the final quality and yield of cheese.[47] dairy goats in their prime (generally around the third or fourth lactation cycle) average—2.7 to 3.6 kg (6 to 8 lb)—of milk production daily—roughly 2.8 to 3.8 l (3 to 4 u.s. qt)—during a ten-month lactation, producing more just after freshening and gradually dropping in production toward the end of their lactation. the milk generally averages 3.5% butterfat.[48] goat milk is commonly processed into cheese, butter, ice cream, yogurt, cajeta and other products. goat cheese is known as fromage de chèvre (""goat cheese"") in france. some varieties include rocamadour and montrachet.[49] goat butter is white because goats produce milk with the yellow beta-carotene converted to a colorless form of vitamin a. goat milk has less cholesterol [50] the american academy of pediatrics discourages feeding infants milk derived from goats. an april 2010 case report[51] summarizes their recommendation and presents ""a comprehensive review of the consequences associated with this dangerous practice"", also stating, ""many infants are exclusively fed unmodified goat's milk as a result of cultural beliefs as well as exposure to false online information. anecdotal reports have described a host of morbidities associated with that practice, including severe electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic acidosis, megaloblastic anemia, allergic reactions including life-threatening anaphylactic shock, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and infections."" untreated caprine brucellosis results in a 2% case fatality rate. according to the usda, doe milk is not recommended for human infants because it contains ""inadequate quantities of iron, folate, vitamins c and d, thiamine, niacin, vitamin b6, and pantothenic acid to meet an infant’s nutritional needs"" and may cause harm to an infant's kidneys and could cause metabolic damage.[52] the department of health in the united kingdom has repeatedly released statements stating on various occasions that[53] ""goats' milk is not suitable for babies, and infant formulas and follow-on formulas based on goats' milk protein have not been approved for use in europe"", and ""infant milks based on goats' milk protein are not suitable as a source of nutrition for infants.""[54] moreover, according to the canadian federal health department health canada, most of the dangers of, and counter-indications for, feeding unmodified goat's milk to infants parallel those associated with unmodified cow's milk — especially insofar as allergic reactions go.[55] however, some farming groups promote the practice. for example, small farm today, in 2005, claimed beneficial use in invalid and convalescent diets, proposing that glycerol ethers, possibly important in nutrition for nursing infants, are much higher in does' milk than in cows' milk.[56] a 1970 book on animal breeding claimed that does' milk differs from cows' or humans' milk by having higher digestibility, distinct alkalinity, higher buffering capacity, and certain therapeutic values in human medicine and nutrition.[57] george mateljan suggested doe milk can replace ewe milk or cow milk in diets of those who are allergic to certain mammals' milk.[58] however, like cow milk, doe milk has lactose (sugar), and may cause gastrointestinal problems for individuals with lactose intolerance.[58] in fact, the level of lactose is similar to that of cow milk.[54] some researchers and companies producing goat's milk products have made claims that goat's milk is better for human health than most western cow's milk due to it mostly lacking a form of β-casein proteins called a1, and instead mostly containing the a2 form, which does not metabolize to β-casomorphin 7 in the body.[59][60][61][62] these compositions vary by breed (especially in the nigerian dwarf breed), animal, and point in the lactation period. the angora breed of goats produces long, curling, lustrous locks of mohair. the entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard hairs. the locks constantly grow to four inches or more in length. angora crossbreeds, such as the pygora and the nigora, have been created to produce mohair and/or cashgora on a smaller, easier-to-manage animal. the wool is shorn twice a year, with an average yield of about 4.5 kg (10 lb). most goats have softer insulating hairs nearer the skin, and longer guard hairs on the surface. the desirable fiber for the textile industry is the former, and it goes by several names (down, cashmere and pashmina). the coarse guard hairs are of little value as they are too coarse, difficult to spin and difficult to dye. the cashmere goat produces a commercial quantity of cashmere wool, which is one of the most expensive natural fibers commercially produced; cashmere is very fine and soft. the cashmere goat fiber is harvested once a year, yielding around 260 g (9 oz) of down. in south asia, cashmere is called ""pashmina"" (from persian pashmina, ""fine wool""). in the 18th and early 19th centuries, kashmir (then called cashmere by the british), had a thriving industry producing shawls from goat-hair imported from tibet and tartary through ladakh. the shawls were introduced into western europe when the general in chief of the french campaign in egypt (1799–1802) sent one to paris. since these shawls were produced in the upper kashmir and ladakh region, the wool came to be known as ""cashmere"". goats have been used by humans to clear unwanted vegetation for centuries. they have been described as ""eating machines"" and ""biological control agents"".[65][66] there has been a resurgence of this in north america since 1990, when herds were used to clear dry brush from california hillsides thought to be endangered by potential wildfires. this form of using goats to clear land is sometimes known as conservation grazing. since then, numerous public and private agencies have hired private herds from companies such as rent a goat to perform similar tasks.[65][67] this may be expensive and their smell may be a nuisance.[68] this practice has become popular in the pacific northwest, where they are used to remove invasive species not easily removed by humans, including (thorned) blackberry vines and poison oak.[65][69][70] chattanooga, tn and spartanburg, sc have used goats to control kudzu, an invasive plant species prevalent in the southeastern united states.[71] as a goat's anatomy and physiology is not too dissimilar from that of humans, some countries' militaries use goats to train combat medics. in the united states, goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after the pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the 1980s.[72] while modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body, trainees feel that ""the goat exercise provide[s] a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide"".[73] some people choose goats as a pet because of their ability to form close bonds with their human guardians. because of goats' herd mentality, they will follow their owners around and form close bonds with them. goat breeds fall into overlapping, general categories. they are generally distributed in those used for dairy, fiber, meat, skins, and as companion animals. some breeds are also particularly noted as pack goats. goat breeders' clubs frequently hold shows, where goats are judged on traits relating to conformation, udder quality, evidence of high production, longevity, build and muscling (meat goats and pet goats) and fiber production and the fiber itself (fiber goats). people who show their goats usually keep registered stock and the offspring of award-winning animals command a higher price. registered goats, in general, are usually higher-priced if for no other reason than that records have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and other data of their sires, dams, and other ancestors. a registered doe is usually less of a gamble than buying a doe at random (as at an auction or sale barn) because of these records and the reputation of the breeder. children's clubs such as 4-h also allow goats to be shown. children's shows often include a showmanship class, where the cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor as well as the handler's ability and skill in handling the goat are scored. in a showmanship class, conformation is irrelevant since this is not what is being judged. various ""dairy goat scorecards"" (milking does) are systems used for judging shows in the us. the american dairy goat association (adga) scorecard for an adult doe includes a point system of a hundred total with major categories that include general appearance, the dairy character of a doe (physical traits that aid and increase milk production), body capacity, and specifically for the mammary system. young stock and bucks are judged by different scorecards which place more emphasis on the other three categories; general appearance, body capacity, and dairy character. the american goat society (ags) has a similar, but not identical scorecard that is used in their shows. the miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards. the ""angora goat scorecard"" used by the colored angora goat breeder's association (cagba), which covers the white and the colored goats, includes evaluation of an animal's fleece color, density, uniformity, fineness, and general body confirmation. disqualifications include: a deformed mouth, broken down pasterns, deformed feet, crooked legs, abnormalities of testicles, missing testicles, more than 3 inch split in scrotum, and close-set or distorted horns. archaeologists excavating the ancient city of ebla in syria discovered, among others, the tomb of some king or great noble which included a throne decorated with bronze goat heads. that led to this tomb becoming known as ""the tomb of the lord of the goats"".[74][75] according to norse mythology, the god of thunder, thor, has a chariot that is pulled by the goats tanngrisnir and tanngnjóstr.[76] at night when he sets up camp, thor eats the meat of the goats, but takes care that all bones remain whole. then he wraps the remains up, and in the morning, the goats always come back to life to pull the chariot. when a farmer's son who is invited to share the meal breaks one of the goats' leg bones to suck the marrow, the animal's leg remains broken in the morning, and the boy is forced to serve thor as a servant to compensate for the damage. possibly related, the yule goat is one of the oldest scandinavian and northern european yule and christmas symbols and traditions. yule goat originally denoted the goat that was slaughtered around yule, but it may also indicate a goat figure made out of straw. it is also used about the custom of going door-to-door singing carols and getting food and drinks in return, often fruit, cakes and sweets. ""going yule goat"" is similar to the british custom wassailing, both with heathen roots. the gävle goat is a giant version of the yule goat, erected every year in the swedish city of gävle. the greek god pan is said to have the upper body of a man and the horns and lower body of a goat.[76] pan was a very lustful god, nearly all of the myths involving him had to do with him chasing nymphs. he is also credited with creating the pan flute. the goat is one of the 12-year cycle of animals which appear in the chinese zodiac related to the chinese calendar. each animal is associated with certain personality traits; those born in a year of the goat are predicted to be shy, introverted, creative, and perfectionist. several mythological hybrid creatures are believed to consist of parts of the goat, including the chimera. the capricorn sign in the western zodiac is usually depicted as a goat with a fish's tail. fauns and satyrs are mythological creatures that are part goat and part human. the mineral bromine is named from the greek word ""brόmos"", which means ""stench of he-goats"". popular christian folk tradition in europe associated satan with imagery of goats.[76] a common superstition in the middle ages was that goats whispered lewd sentences in the ears of the saints. the origin of this belief was probably the behavior of the buck in rut, the very epitome of lust. the common medieval depiction of the devil was that of a goat-like face with horns and small beard (a goatee). the black mass, a probably mythological ""satanic mass"", involved satan manifesting as a black goat for worship. the goat has had a lingering connection with satanism and pagan religions, even into modern times. the inverted pentagram, a symbol used in satanism, is said to be shaped like a goat's head. the ""baphomet of mendes"" refers to a satanic goat-like figure from 19th-century occultism. in finland the tradition of nuutinpäivä—st. knut's day, january 13—involves young men dressed as goats (finnish: nuuttipukki) who visit houses. usually the dress was an inverted fur jacket, a leather or birch bark mask, and horns. unlike the analogues santa claus, nuuttipukki was a scary character (cf. krampus). the men dressed as nuuttipukki wandered from house to house, came in, and typically demanded food from the household and especially leftover alcoholic beverages. in finland the nuuttipukki tradition is still kept alive in areas of satakunta, southwest finland and ostrobothnia. however, nowadays the character is usually played by children and now involves a happy encounter.[77] the common russian surname kozlov (russian: козло́в), means ""goat"". goatee refers to a style of facial hair incorporating hair on a man's chin, so named because of some similarity to a goat's facial feature. goats are mentioned many times in the bible. their importance in ancient israel is indicated by the seven different hebrew and three greek terms used in the bible.[78] a goat is considered a ""clean"" animal by jewish dietary laws and a kid was slaughtered for an honored guest. it was also acceptable for some kinds of sacrifices. goat-hair curtains were used in the tent that contained the tabernacle (exodus 25:4). its horns can be used instead of sheep's horn to make a shofar.[79] on yom kippur, the festival of the day of atonement, two goats were chosen and lots were drawn for them. one was sacrificed and the other allowed to escape into the wilderness, symbolically carrying with it the sins of the community. from this comes the word ""scapegoat"". a leader or king was sometimes compared to a male goat leading the flock. in the new testament (matthew 25), jesus returned to jerusalem the first day of the week (sunday) before his crucifixion. having visited the jewish temple, jesus met with his disciples on the mount of olives outside the city. at the end of an extended discourse he told of a time after his resurrection when he would return in glory and sit in judgement of gentile nations of the world using a metaphor of the sheep and the goats. commonly sheep and goats grazed together in mixed herds.[78] in matthew 25:31–46, jesus said that like a shepherd he will separate the nations placing on his right hand the sheep, those who have shown kindness to needy and suffering disciples of jesus and others. these he will reward, but the goats at his left hand, who failed to show kindness, will be punished. although both sheep and goats were valued as livestock, this preference for sheep may relate to the importance of wool and the superior meat of adult sheep compared to the poor meat of adult goats.[78] goats readily revert to the wild (become feral) if given the opportunity. the only domestic animal known to return to feral life as swiftly is the cat.[6] feral goats have established themselves in many areas: they occur in australia, new zealand, great britain, the galapagos and in many other places. when feral goats reach large populations in habitats which provide unlimited water supply and which do not contain sufficient large predators or which are otherwise vulnerable to goats' aggressive grazing habits, they may have serious effects, such as removing native scrub, trees and other vegetation which is required by a wide range of other creatures, not just other grazing or browsing animals. feral goats are common in australia.[80] however, in other circumstances where predator pressure is maintained, they may be accommodated into some balance in the local food web. "
frog," archaeobatrachia mesobatrachia neobatrachia  – list of anuran families a frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order anura (literally without tail in ancient greek). the oldest fossil ""proto-frog"" appeared in the early triassic of madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the permian, 265 million years ago. frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. there are over 6,300 recorded species, which account for around 88% of extant amphibian species. they are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal, not from taxonomy or evolutionary history. all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads.[1] an adult frog has a stout body, protruding eyes, anteriorly-attached tongue, limbs folded underneath, and no tail (except in tailed frogs). frogs have glandular skin, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. their skin varies in colour from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators. adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land; some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. frogs typically lay their eggs in water. the eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. they have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. the life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. a few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on plant matter. frog skin has a rich microbiome which is important to their health. frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. they are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. the skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive. frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and religion. they are also seen as environmental bellwethers, with declines in frog populations often viewed as early warning signs of environmental damage. frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. more than one third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over 120 are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. the number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them. the use of the common names ""frog"" and ""toad"" has no taxonomic justification. from a classification perspective, all members of the order anura are frogs, but only members of the family bufonidae are considered ""true toads"". the use of the term ""frog"" in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term ""toad"" generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins.[2][3] there are numerous exceptions to this rule. the european fire-bellied toad (bombina bombina) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat[4] whereas the panamanian golden frog (atelopus zeteki) is in the toad family bufonidae and has a smooth skin.[5] the origin of the order name anura—and its original spelling anoures—is the ancient greek ""alpha privative"" prefix ἀν- (an-) ""without"", and οὐρά (ourá), meaning ""animal tail"". it refers to the tailless character of these amphibians.[6][7][8] the origins of the word frog are uncertain and debated.[9] the word is first attested in old english as frogga, but the usual old english word for the frog was frosc (with variants such as frox and forsc), and it is agreed that the word frog is somehow related to this. old english frosc remained in dialectal use in english as frosh and frosk into the nineteenth century,[10] and is paralleled widely in other germanic languages, with examples in the modern languages including german frosch, icelandic froskur, and dutch (kik)vors.[9] these words allow us to reconstruct a common germanic ancestor *froskaz.[11] the third edition of the oxford english dictionary finds that the etymology of *froskaz is uncertain, but agrees with arguments that it could plausibly derive from a proto-indo-european base along the lines of *preu = ""jump"".[9][12] how old english frosc gave rise to frogga is, however, uncertain, as the development does not involve a regular sound-change. instead, it seems that there was a trend in old english to coin nicknames for animals ending in -g, with examples—themselves all of uncertain etymology—including dog, hog, pig, stag, and (ear)wig. frog appears to have been adapted from frosc as part of this trend.[9] meanwhile, the word toad, first attested as old english tādige, is unique to english and is likewise of uncertain etymology.[13] it is the basis for the word tadpole, first attested as middle english taddepol, apparently meaning 'toad-head'.[14] about 88% of amphibian species are classified in the order anura.[15] these include over 7,100 species in 55 families, of which the craugastoridae (850 spp.), hylidae (724 spp.), microhylidae (688 spp.), and bufonidae (621 spp.) are the richest in species.[16] the anura include all modern frogs and any fossil species that fit within the anuran definition. the characteristics of anuran adults include: 9 or fewer presacral vertebrae, the presence of a urostyle formed of fused vertebrae, no tail, a long and forward-sloping ilium, shorter fore limbs than hind limbs, radius and ulna fused, tibia and fibula fused, elongated ankle bones, absence of a prefrontal bone, presence of a hyoid plate, a lower jaw without teeth (with the exception of gastrotheca guentheri) consisting of three pairs of bones (angulosplenial, dentary, and mentomeckelian, with the last pair being absent in pipoidea),[17] an unsupported tongue, lymph spaces underneath the skin, and a muscle, the protractor lentis, attached to the lens of the eye.[18] the anuran larva or tadpole has a single central respiratory spiracle and mouthparts consisting of keratinous beaks and denticles.[18] frogs and toads are broadly classified into three suborders: archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and neobatrachia, by far the largest group, which contains the remaining families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. the suborder neobatrachia is further divided into the two superfamilies hyloidea and ranoidea.[19] this classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. while this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.[20] some species of anurans hybridize readily. for instance, the edible frog (pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the pool frog (p. lessonae) and the marsh frog (p. ridibundus).[21] the fire-bellied toads bombina bombina and b. variegata are similar in forming hybrids. these are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.[22] the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated. a molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fishes. this would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split.[23] another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl-origin hypothesis is more credible than other theories. the neobatrachians seemed to have originated in africa/india, the salamanders in east asia and the caecilians in tropical pangaea.[24] other researchers, while agreeing with the main thrust of this study, questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data. they proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the permian, rather less than 300 million years ago, a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data.[25] a further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological, as well as molecular data, came to the conclusion that lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within lepospondyli rather than within temnospondyli. the study postulated that lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late carboniferous, some 290 to 305 million years ago. the split between anura and caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.[26] in 2008, gerobatrachus hottoni, a temnospondyl with many frog- and salamander-like characteristics, was discovered in texas. it dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a missing link, a stem batrachian close to the common ancestor of frogs and salamanders, consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that frogs and salamanders are more closely related to each other (forming a clade called batrachia) than they are to caecilians.[27][28] however, others have suggested that gerobatrachus hottoni was only a dissorophoid temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibians.[29] salientia (latin salere (salio), ""to jump"") is the name of the total group that includes modern frogs in the order anura as well as their close fossil relatives, the ""proto-frogs"" or ""stem-frogs"". the common features possessed by these proto-frogs include 14 presacral vertebrae (modern frogs have eight or 9), a long and forward-sloping ilium in the pelvis, the presence of a frontoparietal bone, and a lower jaw without teeth. the earliest known amphibians that were more closely related to frogs than to salamanders are triadobatrachus massinoti, from the early triassic period of madagascar (about 250 million years ago), and czatkobatrachus polonicus, from the early triassic of poland (about the same age as triadobatrachus).[30] the skull of triadobatrachus is frog-like, being broad with large eye sockets, but the fossil has features diverging from modern frogs. these include a longer body with more vertebrae. the tail has separate vertebrae unlike the fused urostyle or coccyx in modern frogs. the tibia and fibula bones are also separate, making it probable that triadobatrachus was not an efficient leaper.[30] the earliest known ""true frogs"" that fall into the anuran lineage proper all lived in the early jurassic period.[2][31] one such early frog species, prosalirus bitis, was discovered in 1995 in the kayenta formation of arizona and dates back to the early jurassic epoch (199.6 to 175 million years ago), making prosalirus somewhat more recent than triadobatrachus.[32] like the latter, prosalirus did not have greatly enlarged legs, but had the typical three-pronged pelvic structure of modern frogs. unlike triadobatrachus, prosalirus had already lost nearly all of its tail[33] and was well adapted for jumping.[34] another early jurassic frog is vieraella herbsti, which is known only from dorsal and ventral impressions of a single animal and was estimated to be 33 mm (1.3 in) from snout to vent. notobatrachus degiustoi from the middle jurassic is slightly younger, about 155–170 million years old. the main evolutionary changes in this species involved the shortening of the body and the loss of the tail. the evolution of modern anura likely was complete by the jurassic period. since then, evolutionary changes in chromosome numbers have taken place about 20 times faster in mammals than in frogs, which means speciation is occurring more rapidly in mammals.[35] according to genetic studies, the families hyloidea, microhylidae, and the clade natatanura (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, soon after the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event associated with the chicxulub impactor. all origins of arboreality (e.g. in hyloidea and natatanura) follow from that time and the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards.[36][37] frog fossils have been found on all of the earth's continents.[38][39] in 2020, it was announced that 40 million year old helmeted frog fossils had been discovered by a team of vertebrate paleontologists in seymour island on the antarctic peninsula, indicating that this region was once home to frogs related to those now living in south american nothofagus forest.[40] a cladogram showing the relationships of the different families of frogs in the clade anura can be seen in the table below. this diagram, in the form of a tree, shows how each frog family is related to other families, with each node representing a point of common ancestry. it is based on frost et al. (2006),[41] heinicke et al. (2009)[42] and pyron and wiens (2011).[43] leiopelmatidae ascaphidae bombinatoridae alytidae discoglossidae pipidae rhinophrynidae scaphiopodidae pelodytidae pelobatidae megophryidae heleophrynidae

rhacophoridae mantellidae ranidae frogs have no tail, except as larvae, and most have long hind legs, elongated ankle bones, webbed toes, no claws, large eyes, and a smooth or warty skin. they have short vertebral columns, with no more than 10 free vertebrae and fused tailbones (urostyle or coccyx).[44] like other amphibians, oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins. this unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air, respiring through their skins.[45] ribs are generally absent, so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them.[45] for the skin to serve as a respiratory organ, it must remain moist. this makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in the environment, some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in the water film and be passed into their bloodstream. this may be one of the causes of the worldwide decline in frog populations.[46][47][48][49] frogs range in size from paedophryne amauensis of papua new guinea that is 7.7 mm (0.30 in) in snout–to–vent length[50] to the up to 32 cm (13 in) and 3.25 kg (7.2 lb) goliath frog (conraua goliath) of central africa.[51] there are prehistoric, extinct species that reached even larger sizes.[52] the skin hangs loosely on the body because of the lack of loose connective tissue. frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is transparent to protect the eyes underwater, and two vary from translucent to opaque. they have a tympanum on each side of their heads which is involved in hearing and, in some species, is covered by skin. true toads completely lack teeth, but most frogs have them, specifically pedicellate teeth in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous tissue. these are on the edge of the upper jaw and vomerine teeth are also on the roof of their mouths. no teeth are in the lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole. the teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it in place until swallowed, a process assisted by retracting the eyes into the head.[53] the african bullfrog (pyxicephalus), which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs, has cone shaped bony projections called odontoid processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth.[15] the structure of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees, or in burrows. frogs must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them to do so. most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose. the tibia, fibula, and tarsals have been fused into a single, strong bone, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs (which must absorb the impact on landing). the metatarsals have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow frogs to push against the ground for a longer period on take-off. the illium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. the tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. this enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap.[44] the muscular system has been similarly modified. the hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. however, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified to contribute to the action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. the muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.[54] many frogs have webbed feet and the degree of webbing is directly proportional to the amount of time the species spends in the water.[55] the completely aquatic african dwarf frog (hymenochirus sp.) has fully webbed toes, whereas those of white's tree frog (litoria caerulea), an arboreal species, are only a quarter or half webbed.[56] exceptions include flying frogs in the hylidae and rhacophoridae, which also have fully webbed toes used in gliding. arboreal frogs have pads located on the ends of their toes to help grip vertical surfaces. these are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. when the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. this allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.[57] in many arboreal frogs, a small ""intercalary structure"" on each toe increases the surface area touching the substrate. furthermore, many arboreal frogs have hip joints that allow both hopping and walking. some frogs that live high in trees even possess an elaborate degree of webbing between their toes. this allows the frogs to ""parachute"" or make a controlled glide from one position in the canopy to another.[58] ground-dwelling frogs generally lack the adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs. most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. some burrowing frogs such as couch's spadefoot (scaphiopus couchii) have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a keratinised tubercle often referred to as a spade, that helps them to burrow.[59] sometimes during the tadpole stage, one of the developing rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a dragonfly nymph. in some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. occasionally, a parasitic flatworm (ribeiroia ondatrae) digs into the rear of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops one or more extra legs.[60] a frog's skin is protective, has a respiratory function, can absorb water, and helps control body temperature. it has many glands, particularly on the head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). the secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators.[61] the skin is shed every few weeks. it usually splits down the middle of the back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. the sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.[62] being cold-blooded, frogs have to adopt suitable behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. to warm up, they can move into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. this posture is also used to prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body.[63] the colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. in cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. the grey foam-nest tree frog (chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.[64] many frogs are able to absorb water and oxygen directly through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several south american species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. other frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. this reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss.[63] woodhouse's toad (bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate.[65] the male hairy frog (trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. they contain blood vessels and are thought to increase the area of the skin available for respiration.[66] some species have bony plates embedded in their skin, a trait that appears to have evolved independently several times.[67] in certain other species, the skin at the top of the head is compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is co-ossified with the bones of the skull (exostosis).[68][69] camouflage is a common defensive mechanism in frogs. most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out a position where they can blend into the background and remain undetected. some frogs have the ability to change colour, but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. for example, white's tree frog (litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the pacific tree frog (pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour.[70] features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.[45] some are even able to control their skin texture.[71] wood frog:(lithobates sylvaticus or rana sylvatica) uses disruptive coloration including black eye markings similar to voids between leaves, bands of the dorsal skin (dorsolateral dermal plica) similar to a leaf midrib as well as stains, spots & leg stripes similar to fallen leaf features. pouched frog (assa darlingtoni) camouflaged against leaf litter. the skin of a frog is permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as to water. there are blood vessels near the surface of the skin and when a frog is underwater, oxygen diffuses directly into the blood. when not submerged, a frog breathes by a process known as buccal pumping. its lungs are similar to those of humans, but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration, and no ribs or diaphragm exist to help move air in and out. instead, it puffs out its throat and draws air in through the nostrils, which in many species can then be closed by valves. when the floor of the mouth is compressed, air is forced into the lungs.[72] the fully aquatic bornean flat-headed frog (barbourula kalimantanensis) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.[73] frogs have three-chambered hearts, a feature they share with lizards.[74] oxygenated blood from the lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through separate atria. when these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. the ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of the two types of blood. these features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.[74] some species of frog have adaptations that allow them to survive in oxygen deficient water. the titicaca water frog (telmatobius culeus) is one such species and has wrinkly skin that increases its surface area to enhance gas exchange. it normally makes no use of its rudimentary lungs but will sometimes raise and lower its body rhythmically while on the lake bed to increase the flow of water around it.[75] frogs have maxillary teeth along their upper jaw which are used to hold food before it is swallowed. these teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. the tongue normally lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. it can be shot out and retracted at great speed.[55] some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands.[55] the eyes assist in the swallowing of food as they can be retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat.[55] the food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. it then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. the food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.[76] the recently discovered prometheus frog has been reported to sometimes eat cooked or burnt food from areas affected by forest fires.[77] although adapted to terrestrial life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in their inability to conserve body water effectively. when they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. the excretory system is similar to that of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules.[78] the nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. a few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid.[78] the urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. all bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.[79] in the male frog, the two testes are attached to the kidneys and semen passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. it then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. there is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. the ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.[79] when frogs mate, the male climbs on the back of the female and wraps his fore limbs round her body, either behind the front legs or just in front of the hind legs. this position is called amplexus and may be held for several days.[80] the male frog has certain hormone-dependent secondary sexual characteristics. these include the development of special pads on his thumbs in the breeding season, to give him a firm hold.[81] the grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release eggs, usually wrapped in jelly, as spawn.[79] in many species the male is smaller and slimmer than the female. males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks, particularly in the breeding season, and in some species they also have vocal sacs to amplify the sound.[79] frogs have a highly developed nervous system that consists of a brain, spinal cord and nerves. many parts of frog brains correspond with those of humans. it consists of two olfactory lobes, two cerebral hemispheres, a pineal body, two optic lobes, a cerebellum and a medulla oblongata. muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata regulates respiration, digestion and other automatic functions.[79] the relative size of the cerebrum in frogs is much smaller than it is in humans. frogs have ten pairs of cranial nerves which pass information from the outside directly to the brain, and ten pairs of spinal nerves which pass information from the extremities to the brain through the spinal cord.[79] by contrast, all amniotes (mammals, birds and reptiles) have twelve pairs of cranial nerves.[82] the eyes of most frogs are located on either side of the head near the top and project outwards as hemispherical bulges. they provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°.[83] they may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming.[84] members of the aquatic family pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above.[83] the irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. the common toad (bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. the irises of the southern toad (anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.[84] the distant vision of a frog is better than its near vision. calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an intruder or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen.[84] when a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended.[55] although it was formerly debated,[85] more recent research has shown that frogs can see in colour, even in very low light.[86] frogs can hear both in the air and below water. they do not have external ears; the eardrums (tympanic membranes) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. the size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. in some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size.[87] a noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. the middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. in the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. the former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies.[88] because the cochlea is short, frogs use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds.[89] this arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their conspecifics. in some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state.[88] a frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.[87] the call or croak of a frog is unique to its species. frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. in most calling frogs, the sound is amplified by one or more vocal sacs, membranes of skin under the throat or on the corner of the mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.[90] additionally, some species have been found to use man-made structures such as drain pipes for artificial amplification of their call.[91] frogs in the genera heleioporus and neobatrachus lack vocal sacs but can still produce a loud call. their buccal cavity is enlarged and dome-shaped, acting as a resonance chamber that amplifies the sound. species of frog that lack vocal sacs and that do not have a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing water. they need to use an alternative means to communicate. the coastal tailed frog (ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in north america and does not vocalize.[92] the main reason for calling is to allow male frogs to attract a mate. males may call individually or there may be a chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. females of many frog species, such as the common tree frog (polypedates leucomystax), reply to the male calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony.[93] female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out in a crowd. the rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.[94] a different call is emitted by a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. this is a distinct chirruping sound and is accompanied by a vibration of the body.[95] tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower.[95] many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. all of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed.[95] a distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. it is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorient the attacker so that it releases the frog.[95] many species of frog have deep calls. the croak of the american bullfrog (rana catesbiana) is sometimes written as ""jug o' rum"".[96] the pacific tree frog (pseudacris regilla) produces the onomatopoeic ""ribbit"" often heard in films.[97] other renderings of frog calls into speech include ""brekekekex koax koax"", the call of the marsh frog (pelophylax ridibundus) in the frogs, an ancient greek comic drama by aristophanes.[98] the calls of the concave-eared torrent frog (amolops tormotus) are unusual in many aspects. the males are notable for their varieties of calls where upward and downward frequency modulations take place. when they communicate, they produce calls that fall in the ultrasound frequency range. the last aspect that makes this species of frog's calls unusual is that nonlinear acoustic phenomena are important components in their acoustic signals.[99] during extreme conditions, some frogs enter a state of torpor and remain inactive for months. in colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. those that live on land such as the american toad (bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. aquatic species such as the american bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) normally sink to the bottom of the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. some frogs such as the wood frog or spring peeper can even survive being frozen. ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. an apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and its heartbeat can restart when conditions warm up.[100] at the other extreme, the striped burrowing frog (cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in australia, surviving in a dormant state without access to food and water for nine or ten months of the year. it burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. researchers at the university of queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. this means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. this survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious for an extended period of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat.[101] other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected.[102] frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees celsius.[103] different species of frog use a number of methods of moving around including jumping, running, walking, swimming, burrowing, climbing and gliding. frogs are generally recognized as exceptional jumpers and, relative to their size, the best jumpers of all vertebrates.[104] the striped rocket frog, litoria nasuta, can leap over 2 metres (6 ft 7 in), a distance that is more than fifty times its body length of 5.5 centimetres (2.2 in).[105] there are tremendous differences between species in jumping capability. within a species, jump distance increases with increasing size, but relative jumping distance (body-lengths jumped) decreases. the indian skipper frog (euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has the ability to leap out of the water from a position floating on the surface.[106] the tiny northern cricket frog (acris crepitans) can ""skitter"" across the surface of a pond with a series of short rapid jumps.[107] slow-motion photography shows that the muscles have passive flexibility. they are first stretched while the frog is still in the crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. the fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position for the duration of the jump.[54] in some extremely capable jumpers, such as the cuban tree frog (osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. when the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration.[108] a similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.[109] early hatching of froglets can have negative effects on frog jumping performance and overall locomotion.[110] the hindlimbs are unable to completely form, which results in them being shorter and much weaker relative to a normal hatching froglet.[110] early hatching froglets may tend to depend on other forms of locomotion more often, such as swimming and walking.[110] frogs in the families bufonidae, rhinophrynidae, and microhylidae have short back legs and tend to walk rather than jump.[111] when they try to move rapidly, they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait. the great plains narrow-mouthed toad (gastrophryne olivacea) has been described as having a gait that is ""a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length"".[112] in an experiment, fowler's toad (bufo fowleri) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds. by measuring the toad's uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high-intensity activity.[113] the red-legged running frog (kassina maculata) has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. it can move fast by using a running gait in which the two hind legs are used alternately. slow-motion photography shows, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog's gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds.[114] this species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects.[115] the indian skipper frog (euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has broad feet and can run across the surface of the water for several metres (yards).[107] frogs that live in or visit water have adaptations that improve their swimming abilities. the hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. the webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases the area of the foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. members of the family pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. they have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet.[116] tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side.[117] some frogs have become adapted for burrowing and a life underground. they tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. an extreme example of this is the purple frog (nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) from southern india which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground. it emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pools. it has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.[118] the spadefoot toads of north america are also adapted to underground life. the plains spadefoot toad (spea bombifrons) is typical and has a flap of keratinised bone attached to one of the metatarsals of the hind feet which it uses to dig itself backwards into the ground. as it digs, the toad wriggles its hips from side to side to sink into the loose soil. it has a shallow burrow in the summer from which it emerges at night to forage. in winter, it digs much deeper and has been recorded at a depth of 4.5 m (15 ft).[119] the tunnel is filled with soil and the toad hibernates in a small chamber at the end. during this time, urea accumulates in its tissues and water is drawn in from the surrounding damp soil by osmosis to supply the toad's needs.[119] spadefoot toads are ""explosive breeders"", all emerging from their burrows at the same time and converging on temporary pools, attracted to one of these by the calling of the first male to find a suitable breeding location.[120] the burrowing frogs of australia have a rather different lifestyle. the western spotted frog (heleioporus albopunctatus) digs a burrow beside a river or in the bed of an ephemeral stream and regularly emerges to forage. mating takes place and eggs are laid in a foam nest inside the burrow. the eggs partially develop there, but do not hatch until they are submerged following heavy rainfall. the tadpoles then swim out into the open water and rapidly complete their development.[121] madagascan burrowing frogs are less fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter. one of these, the green burrowing frog (scaphiophryne marmorata), has a flattened head with a short snout and well-developed metatarsal tubercles on its hind feet to help with excavation. it also has greatly enlarged terminal discs on its fore feet that help it to clamber around in bushes.[122] it breeds in temporary pools that form after rains.[123] tree frogs live high in the canopy, where they scramble around on the branches, twigs, and leaves, sometimes never coming down to earth. the ""true"" tree frogs belong to the family hylidae, but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit, a case of convergent evolution. these include the glass frogs (centrolenidae), the bush frogs (hyperoliidae), some of the narrow-mouthed frogs (microhylidae), and the shrub frogs (rhacophoridae).[111] most tree frogs are under 10 cm (4 in) in length, with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips. the surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat-topped, hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus. these toe pads, moistened by the mucus, provide the grip on any wet or dry surface, including glass. the forces involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis on the surface and also surface tension and viscosity.[124] tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed.[125] some members of the subfamily phyllomedusinae have opposable toes on their feet. the reticulated leaf frog (phyllomedusa ayeaye) has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet. this allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat.[126] during the evolutionary history of frogs, several different groups have independently taken to the air.[127] some frogs in the tropical rainforest are specially adapted for gliding from tree to tree or parachuting to the forest floor. typical of them is wallace's flying frog (rhacophorus nigropalmatus) from malaysia and borneo. it has large feet with the fingertips expanded into flat adhesive discs and the digits fully webbed. flaps of skin occur on the lateral margins of the limbs and across the tail region. with the digits splayed, the limbs outstretched, and these flaps spread, it can glide considerable distances, but is unable to undertake powered flight.[128] it can alter its direction of travel and navigate distances of up to 15 m (49 ft) between trees.[129] like other amphibians, the life cycle of a frog normally starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills, commonly known as a tadpole. after further growth, during which it develops limbs and lungs, the tadpole undergoes metamorphosis in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged. after this it is able to leave the water as a miniature, air-breathing frog. direct development, where eggs hatch into juveniles like small adults, is also known in many frogs, for example, ischnocnema henselii,[130] eleutherodactylus coqui,[131] and raorchestes ochlandrae and raorchestes chalazodes.[132] two main types of reproduction occur in frogs, prolonged breeding and explosive breeding. in the former, adopted by the majority of species, adult frogs at certain times of year assemble at a pond, lake or stream to breed. many frogs return to the bodies of water in which they developed as larvae. this often results in annual migrations involving thousands of individuals. in explosive breeders, mature adult frogs arrive at breeding sites in response to certain trigger factors such as rainfall occurring in an arid area. in these frogs, mating and spawning take place promptly and the speed of larval growth is rapid in order to make use of the ephemeral pools before they dry up.[133] among prolonged breeders, males usually arrive at the breeding site first and remain there for some time whereas females tend to arrive later and depart soon after they have spawned. this means that males outnumber females at the water's edge and defend territories from which they expel other males. they advertise their presence by calling, often alternating their croaks with neighbouring frogs. larger, stronger males tend to have deeper calls and maintain higher quality territories. females select their mates at least partly on the basis of the depth of their voice.[134] in some species there are satellite males who have no territory and do not call. they may intercept females that are approaching a calling male or take over a vacated territory. calling is an energy-sapping activity. sometimes the two roles are reversed and a calling male gives up its territory and becomes a satellite.[133] in explosive breeders, the first male that finds a suitable breeding location, such as a temporary pool, calls loudly and other frogs of both sexes converge on the pool. explosive breeders tend to call in unison creating a chorus that can be heard from far away. the spadefoot toads (scaphiopus spp.) of north america fall into this category. mate selection and courtship is not as important as speed in reproduction. in some years, suitable conditions may not occur and the frogs may go for two or more years without breeding.[133] some female new mexico spadefoot toads (spea multiplicata) only spawn half of the available eggs at a time, perhaps retaining some in case a better reproductive opportunity arises later.[135] at the breeding site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. typically, amplexus takes place in the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. in many species such as the great plains toad (bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes.[133] members of the west african genus nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; limnonectes larvaepartus, eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the tanzanian genus nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. in these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except l. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.[136][137][138] frogs' embryos are typically surrounded by several layers of gelatinous material. when several eggs are clumped together, they are collectively known as frogspawn. the jelly provides support and protection while allowing the passage of oxygen, carbon dioxide and ammonia. it absorbs moisture and swells on contact with water. after fertilization, the innermost portion liquifies to allow free movement of the developing embryo. in certain species, such as the northern red-legged frog (rana aurora) and the wood frog (rana sylvatica), symbiotic unicellular green algae are present in the gelatinous material. it is thought that these may benefit the developing larvae by providing them with extra oxygen through photosynthesis.[139] most eggs are black or dark brown and this has the advantage of absorbing warmth from the sun which the insulating capsule retains. the interior of globular egg clusters of the wood frog (rana sylvatica) has been found to be up to 6 °c (11 °f) warmer than the surrounding water and this speeds up the development of the larvae.[140] the shape and size of the egg mass is characteristic of the species. ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. the tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil.[141] the smoky jungle frog (leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. the eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur.[142] the red-eyed treefrog (agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below.[143] the larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten.[144] in general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.[145] the larvae that emerge from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or occasionally polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. as a general rule, free-living larvae are fully aquatic, but at least one species (nannophrys ceylonensis) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks.[146][147] tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, lateral line systems, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.[117] from early in its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. the lungs soon start to develop and are used as an accessory breathing organ. some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, but the number of rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification.[145] in the pipidae, with the exception of hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish.[116] their tails are stiffened by a notochord, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. this has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. the tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.[148] tadpoles are typically herbivorous, feeding mostly on algae, including diatoms filtered from the water through the gills. some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. the cuban tree frog (osteopilus septentrionalis) is one of a number of species in which the tadpoles can be cannibalistic. tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by the others, so late developers may have better long-term survival prospects.[149] tadpoles are highly vulnerable to being eaten by fish, newts, predatory diving beetles, and birds, such as kingfishers. some tadpoles, including those of the cane toad (bufo marinus), are poisonous. the tadpole stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders or it may last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in the spring.[150] at the end of the tadpole stage, a frog undergoes metamorphosis in which its body makes a sudden transition into the adult form. this metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours, and is initiated by production of the hormone thyroxine. this causes different tissues to develop in different ways. the principal changes that take place include the development of the lungs and the disappearance of the gills and gill pouch, making the front legs visible. the lower jaw transforms into the big mandible of the carnivorous adult, and the long, spiral gut of the herbivorous tadpole is replaced by the typical short gut of a predator.[145] the nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and stereoscopic vision, and for new methods of locomotion and feeding.[145] the eyes are repositioned higher up on the head and the eyelids and associated glands are formed. the eardrum, middle ear, and inner ear are developed. the skin becomes thicker and tougher, the lateral line system is lost, and skin glands are developed.[145] the final stage is the disappearance of the tail, but this takes place rather later, the tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in the limbs.[151] frogs are at their most vulnerable to predators when they are undergoing metamorphosis. at this time, the tail is being lost and locomotion by means of limbs is only just becoming established.[111] larva of the common frog rana temporaria a day before metamorphosis metamorphosis stage with deforming jaws, large eyes, and remains of gill pouch young frog with a stumpy tail, metamorphosis nearly complete after metamorphosis, young adults may disperse into terrestrial habitats or continue to live in water. almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. a few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. a few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit,[152] leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants,[153][154] and folivory occurs in euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume.[155] adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. the northern leopard frog (rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.[156] frogs are primary predators and an important part of the food web. being cold-blooded, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into biomass. they are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. by reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.[157] little is known about the longevity of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. the oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage.[158] captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a european common toad (bufo bufo). the cane toad (bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the american bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) 14 years.[159] frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (rana sylvatica).[160] although care of offspring is poorly understood in frogs, up to an estimated 20% of amphibian species may care for their young in some way.[161] the evolution of parental care in frogs is driven primarily by the size of the water body in which they breed. those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour.[162] because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies, some frog species started to lay their eggs on land. once this happened, the desiccating terrestrial environment demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival.[163] the subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care.[162] in small pools, predators are mostly absent and competition between tadpoles becomes the variable that constrains their survival. certain frog species avoid this competition by making use of smaller phytotelmata (water-filled leaf axils or small woody cavities) as sites for depositing a few tadpoles.[164] while these smaller rearing sites are free from competition, they also lack sufficient nutrients to support a tadpole without parental assistance. frog species that changed from the use of larger to smaller phytotelmata have evolved a strategy of providing their offspring with nutritive but unfertilized eggs.[162] the female strawberry poison-dart frog (oophaga pumilio) lays her eggs on the forest floor. the male frog guards them from predation and carries water in his cloaca to keep them moist. when they hatch, the female moves the tadpoles on her back to a water-holding bromeliad or other similar water body, depositing just one in each location. she visits them regularly and feeds them by laying one or two unfertilized eggs in the phytotelma, continuing to do this until the young are large enough to undergo metamorphosis.[165] the granular poison frog (oophaga granulifera) looks after its tadpoles in a similar way.[166] many other diverse forms of parental care are seen in frogs. the tiny male colostethus subpunctatus stands guard over his egg cluster, laid under a stone or log. when the eggs hatch, he transports the tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool, where he partially immerses himself in the water and one or more tadpoles drop off. he then moves on to another pool.[167] the male common midwife toad (alytes obstetricans) carries the eggs around with him attached to his hind legs. he keeps them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond, and prevents them from getting too wet in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarters. after three to six weeks, he travels to a pond and the eggs hatch into tadpoles.[168] the tungara frog (physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation. the foam is made from proteins and lectins, and seems to have antimicrobial properties.[169] several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft. the eggs are laid in the centre, followed by alternate layers of foam and eggs, finishing with a foam capping.[170] some frogs protect their offspring inside their own bodies. both male and female pouched frogs (assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. when the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. the tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs.[171] the female gastric-brooding frog (rheobatrachus sp.) from australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. she ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. the tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. after six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. the mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth.[172] the female darwin's frog (rhinoderma darwinii) from chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. when the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. they remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.[173] at first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless because of their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of defensive structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.[133] the skin of many frogs contains mild toxic substances called bufotoxins to make them unpalatable to potential predators. most toads and some frogs have large poison glands, the parotoid glands, located on the sides of their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies. these glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous. if the noxious effect is immediate, the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape. if the effect develops more slowly, the predator may learn to avoid that species in future.[174] poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours, an adaptive strategy known as aposematism. the poison dart frogs in the family dendrobatidae do this. they are typically red, orange, or yellow, often with contrasting black markings on their bodies. allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of two different toxic species with which it shares a common range in an effort to deceive predators.[175] other species, such as the european fire-bellied toad (bombina bombina), have their warning colour underneath. they ""flash"" this when attacked, adopting a pose that exposes the vivid colouring on their bellies.[4] some frogs, such as the poison dart frogs, are especially toxic. the native peoples of south america extract poison from these frogs to apply to their weapons for hunting,[176] although few species are toxic enough to be used for this purpose. at least two non-poisonous frog species in tropical america (eleutherodactylus gaigei and lithodytes lineatus) mimic the colouration of dart poison frogs for self-protection.[177][178] some frogs obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat.[179] others, such as the australian corroboree frogs (pseudophryne corroboree and pseudophryne pengilleyi), can synthesize the alkaloids themselves.[180] the chemicals involved may be irritants, hallucinogens, convulsants, nerve poisons or vasoconstrictors. many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons, but other creatures, including humans who handle the frogs, may be severely affected.[181] some frogs use bluff or deception. the european common toad (bufo bufo) adopts a characteristic stance when attacked, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered.[182] the bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) crouches down with eyes closed and head tipped forward when threatened. this places the parotoid glands in the most effective position, the other glands on its back begin to ooze noxious secretions and the most vulnerable parts of its body are protected.[133] another tactic used by some frogs is to ""scream"", the sudden loud noise tending to startle the predator. the gray tree frog (hyla versicolor) makes an explosive sound that sometimes repels the shrew blarina brevicauda.[133] although toads are avoided by many predators, the common garter snake (thamnophis sirtalis) regularly feeds on them. the strategy employed by juvenile american toads (bufo americanus) on being approached by a snake is to crouch down and remain immobile. this is usually successful, with the snake passing by and the toad remaining undetected. if it is encountered by the snake's head, however, the toad hops away before crouching defensively.[183] frogs live on all the continents except antarctica, but they are not present on certain islands, especially those far away from continental land masses.[184][185] many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory, such as stretches of sea, mountain ridges, deserts, forest clearance, road construction, or other man-made barriers.[186] usually, a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions, such as europe.[187] some frogs inhabit arid areas, such as deserts, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. members of the australian genus cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a water-impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods. once it rains, they emerge, find a temporary pool, and breed. egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those of most other frogs, so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up.[188] some frog species are adapted to a cold environment. the wood frog (rana sylvatica), whose habitat extends into the arctic circle, buries itself in the ground during winter. although much of its body freezes during this time, it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs, which protects them from damage.[55] in 2006, of 4,035 species of amphibians that depend on water during some lifecycle stage, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened. this is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status.[189] frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s. more than one-third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction, and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s.[190] among these species are the gastric-brooding frogs of australia and the golden toad of costa rica. the latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited the pristine monteverde cloud forest reserve and its population crashed in 1987, along with about 20 other frog species in the area. this could not be linked directly to human activities, such as deforestation, and was outside the range of normal fluctuations in population size.[191] elsewhere, habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline, as are pollutants, climate change, increased uvb radiation, and the introduction of non-native predators and competitors.[192] a canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss.[193] emerging infectious diseases, including chytridiomycosis and ranavirus, are also devastating populations.[194][195] many environmental scientists believe amphibians, including frogs, are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health because of their intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults).[196] it appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline, while those with direct development are the most resistant.[197] frog mutations and genetic defects have increased since the 1990s. these often include missing legs or extra legs. various causes have been identified or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn on the surface of ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode ribeiroia ondatrae. probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. an increase in the number of frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.[198][199] in a few cases, captive breeding programs have been established and have largely been successful.[200][201] the world association of zoos and aquariums named 2008 as the ""year of the frog"" in order to draw attention to the conservation issues faced by them.[202] the cane toad (bufo marinus) is a very adaptable species native to south and central america. in the 1930s, it was introduced into puerto rico, and later various other islands in the pacific and caribbean region, as a biological pest control agent.[203] in 1935, 3000 toads were liberated in the sugar cane fields of queensland, australia, in an attempt to control cane beetles such as dermolepida albohirtum, the larvae of which damage and kill the canes. initial results in many of these countries were positive, but it later became apparent that the toads upset the ecological balance in their new environments. they bred freely, competed with native frog species, ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates, had few predators in their adopted habitats, and poisoned pets, carnivorous birds, and mammals. in many of these countries, they are now regarded both as pests and invasive species, and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them.[204] frog legs are eaten by humans in many parts of the world. french cuisses de grenouille or frog legs dish is a traditional dish particularly served in the region of the dombes (département of ain). the dish is also common in french-speaking parts of louisiana, particularly the cajun areas of southern louisiana as well as new orleans, united states. in asia, frog legs are consumed in china, vietnam, thailand and indonesia. chinese edible frog and pig frogs are farmed and consumed on a large scale in some areas of china. frog legs are part of chinese sichuan and cantonese cuisine. in indonesia, frog-leg soup is known as swikee or swike. indonesia is the world's largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5,000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to france, belgium and luxembourg.[205] originally, they were supplied from local wild populations, but overexploitation led to a diminution in the supply. this resulted in the development of frog farming and a global trade in frogs.[206] the main importing countries are france, belgium, luxembourg, and the united states, while the chief exporting nations are indonesia and china.[206] the annual global trade in the american bullfrog (rana catesbeiana), mostly farmed in china, varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes.[207] the mountain chicken frog, so-called as it tastes of chicken, is now endangered, in part due to human consumption, and was a major food choice of the dominicans.[208] coon, possum, partridges, prairie hen, and frogs were among the fare mark twain recorded as part of american cuisine.[209] frogs are used for dissections in high school and university anatomy classes, often first being injected with coloured substances to enhance contrasts among the biological systems. this practice is declining due to animal welfare concerns, and ""digital frogs"" are now available for virtual dissection.[210] frogs have served as experimental animals throughout the history of science. eighteenth-century biologist luigi galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs.[211] in 1852, h. f. stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates.[212] the african clawed frog or platanna (xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests in the first half of the 20th century. a sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by english zoologist lancelot hogben. this is because a hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy.[213] in 1952, robert briggs and thomas j. king cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. this same technique was later used to create dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.[214] frogs are used in cloning research and other branches of embryology. although alternative pregnancy tests have been developed, biologists continue to use xenopus as a model organism in developmental biology because their embryos are large and easy to manipulate, they are readily obtainable, and can easily be kept in the laboratory.[215] xenopus laevis is increasingly being displaced by its smaller relative, xenopus tropicalis, which reaches its reproductive age in five months rather than the one to two years for x. laevis,[216] thus facilitating faster studies across generations. genomes of xenopus laevis, x. tropicalis, rana catesbeiana, rhinella marina, and nanorana parkeri have been sequenced and deposited in the ncbi genome database.[217] due to being inexpensive and relatively easy to care for, many species of frog and toad have become popular as exotic pets, they are undemanding and require low maintenance. because frog toxins are extraordinarily diverse, they have raised the interest of biochemists as a ""natural pharmacy"". the alkaloid epibatidine, a painkiller 200 times more potent than morphine, is made by some species of poison dart frogs. other chemicals isolated from the skins of frogs may offer resistance to hiv infection.[218] dart poisons are under active investigation for their potential as therapeutic drugs.[219] it has long been suspected that pre-columbian mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen, but more likely they used substances secreted by the colorado river toad (bufo alvarius). these contain bufotenin (5-meo-dmt), a psychoactive compound that has been used in modern times as a recreational drug. typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked.[220] illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an urban myth.[221] exudations from the skin of the golden poison frog (phyllobates terribilis) are traditionally used by native colombians to poison the darts they use for hunting. the tip of the projectile is rubbed over the back of the frog and the dart is launched from a blowgun. the combination of the two alkaloid toxins batrachotoxin and homobatrachotoxin is so powerful, one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated 22,000 mice.[222] two other species, the kokoe poison dart frog (phyllobates aurotaenia) and the black-legged dart frog (phyllobates bicolor) are also used for this purpose. these are less toxic and less abundant than the golden poison frog. they are impaled on pointed sticks and may be heated over a fire to maximise the quantity of poison that can be transferred to the dart.[222] frogs feature prominently in folklore, fairy tales, and popular culture. they tend to be portrayed as benign, ugly, and clumsy, but with hidden talents. examples include michigan j. frog, ""the frog prince"", and kermit the frog. the warner brothers cartoon one froggy evening features michigan j. frog, that will only dance and sing for the demolition worker who opens his time capsule, but will not perform in public.[223] ""the frog prince"" is a fairy tale about a frog that turns into a handsome prince after he has rescued a princess's golden ball and she has taken him into her palace.[224] kermit the frog is a conscientious and disciplined character from the muppet show and sesame street; while openly friendly and greatly talented, he is often portrayed as cringing at the fanciful behavior of more flamboyant characters.[225] the moche people of ancient peru worshipped animals, and often depicted frogs in their art.[226] in panama, local legend held that good fortune would come to anyone who spotted a panamanian golden frog. some believed when one of these frogs died, it would turn into a golden talisman known as a huaca. today, despite being extinct in the wild, panamanian golden frogs remain an important cultural symbol and are illustrated on decorative cloth molas made by the kuna people. they also appear as part of the inlaid design on a new overpass in panama city, on t-shirts, and even on lottery tickets.[227] media "
goose," a goose (plural geese) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family anatidae. this group comprises the genera anser (the grey geese and white geese) and branta (the black geese). some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have ""goose"" as part of their names. more distantly related members of the family anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller. the term ""goose"" is more properly used for a female bird, while ""gander"" refers specifically to a male one. young birds before fledging are called goslings.[1] the collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge; when flying close together, they are called a plump.[2] the word ""goose"" is a direct descendant of proto-indo-european root, ghans-. in germanic languages, the root gave old english gōs with the plural gēs and gandres (becoming modern english goose, geese, gander, and gosling, respectively), frisian goes, gies and guoske, new high german gans, gänse, and ganter, and old norse gās. this term also gave lithuanian: žąsìs, irish: gé (goose, from old irish géiss), latin: anser, spanish: ganso, ancient greek: χήν (khēn), dutch: gans, albanian: gatë (heron), sanskrit haṃsa and haṃsī (""gander"" and ""goose"", also the words for male and female swans), finnish: hanhi, avestan zāō, polish: gęś, romanian: gâscă / gânsac, ukrainian: гуска / гусак (huska / husak), russian: гусыня / гусь (gusyna / gus), czech: husa, and persian: غاز‎ (ghāz).[1][3] the two living genera of true geese are: anser, grey geese and white geese, such as the greylag goose and snow goose and branta, black geese, such as the canada goose. two genera of geese are only tentatively placed in the anserinae; they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own: cereopsis, the cape barren goose, and cnemiornis, the prehistoric new zealand goose. either these or, more probably, the goose-like coscoroba swan is the closest living relative of the true geese. fossils of true geese are hard to assign to genus; all that can be said is that their fossil record, particularly in north america, is dense and comprehensively documents many different species of true geese that have been around since about 10 million years ago in the miocene. the aptly named anser atavus (meaning ""progenitor goose"") from some 12 million years ago had even more plesiomorphies in common with swans. in addition, some goose-like birds are known from subfossil remains found on the hawaiian islands. geese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short nesting season. paired geese are more dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young.[4][5] geese honk while in flight to encourage other members of the flock to maintain a 'v-formation' and to help communicate with one another.[6] geese fossils have been found ranging from 10 to 12 million years ago. fossils found in the gagarno region of central italy suggest the existence of a pre-historic relative of the goose, that stood one and a half metres tall. the evidence suggests the bird was flightless unlike modern geese.[7] some mainly southern hemisphere birds are called ""geese"", most of which belong to the shelduck subfamily tadorninae. these are: others: well-known sayings about geese include:[citation needed] the oldest collection of medieval icelandic laws is known as ""grágás""; i.e., the gray goose laws. various etymologies were offered for that name: canada goose gosling canada geese in flight, great meadows wildlife sanctuary "
kangaroo," the kangaroo is a marsupial from the family macropodidae (macropods, meaning ""large foot""). in common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo.[1] kangaroos are indigenous to australia and new guinea. the australian government estimates that 34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of australia in 2011, up from 25.1 million one year earlier.[2] as with the terms ""wallaroo"" and ""wallaby"", ""kangaroo"" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species. all three refer to members of the same taxonomic family, macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size. the largest species in the family are called ""kangaroos"" and the smallest are generally called ""wallabies"". the term ""wallaroos"" refers to species of an intermediate size.[3] there are also the tree-kangaroos, another type of macropod, which inhabit the tropical rainforests of new guinea, far northeastern queensland and some of the islands in the region. a general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be: kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development. the large kangaroos have adapted much better than the smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the australian landscape by humans. many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, while kangaroos are relatively plentiful. the kangaroo is a symbol of australia, appears on the australian coat of arms[4] and on some of its currency,[5] and is used as a logo for some of australia's most well-known organisations, such as qantas,[6] and as the roundel of the royal australian air force.[7] the kangaroo is important to both australian culture and the national image, and consequently there are numerous popular culture references. wild kangaroos are shot for meat, leather hides, and to protect grazing land.[8] although controversial, kangaroo meat has perceived health benefits for human consumption compared with traditional meats due to the low level of fat on kangaroos.[9] the word kangaroo derives from the guugu yimithirr word gangurru, referring to eastern grey kangaroos.[10][11] the name was first recorded as ""kanguru"" on 12 july 1770 in an entry in the diary of sir joseph banks; this occurred at the site of modern cooktown, on the banks of the endeavour river, where hms endeavour under the command of lieutenant james cook was beached for almost seven weeks to repair damage sustained on the great barrier reef.[12] cook first referred to kangaroos in his diary entry of 4 august. guugu yimithirr is the language of the people of the area. a common myth about the kangaroo's english name is that it was a guugu yimithirr phrase for ""i don't know"" or ""i don't understand"".[13] according to this legend, cook and banks were exploring the area when they happened upon the animal. they asked a nearby local what the creatures were called. the local responded ""kangaroo"", said to mean ""i don't know/understand"", which cook then took to be the name of the creature.[14] anthropologist walter roth was trying to correct this legend as far back as in 1898, but few took note until 1972 when linguist john b. haviland in his research with the guugu yimithirr people was able to fully confirm the proper etymology.[14][15] there are similar, more credible stories of naming confusion, such as with the yucatán peninsula.[14] kangaroos are often colloquially referred to as ""roos"".[16] male kangaroos are called bucks, boomers, jacks, or old men; females are does, flyers, or jills; and the young ones are joeys.[17] the collective noun for a group of kangaroos is a mob, court, or troupe.[18] there are four extant species that are commonly referred to as kangaroos: in addition, there are about 50 smaller macropods closely related to the kangaroos in the family macropodidae. kangaroos and other macropods share a common ancestor with the phalangeridae from the middle miocene.[22] this ancestor was likely arboreal and lived in the canopies of the extensive forests that covered most of australia at that time, when the climate was much wetter, and fed on leaves and stems.[23] from the late miocene through the pliocene and into the pleistocene the climate got drier, which led to a decline of forests and expansion of grasslands. at this time, there was a radiation of macropodids characterised by enlarged body size and adaptation to the low quality grass diet with the development of foregut fermentation.[23] the most numerous early macropods, the balbaridae and the bulungmayinae, became extinct in the late miocene around 5–10 mya.[24] there is dispute over the relationships of the two groups to modern kangaroos and rat-kangaroos. some argue that the balbarines were the ancestors of rat-kangaroos and the bulungmayines were the ancestors of kangaroos.[25] while others hold the contrary view.[26] the middle to late bulungmayines, ganguroo and wanburoo lacked digit 1 of the hind foot and digits 2 and 3 were reduced and partly under the large digit 4, much like the modern kangaroo foot. this would indicate that they were bipedal. in addition, their ankle bones had an articulation that would have prohibited much lateral movements, an adaptation for bipedal hopping.[24] species related to the modern grey kangaroos and wallaroos begin to appear in the pliocene. the red kangaroo appears to be the most recently evolved kangaroo, with its fossil record not going back beyond the pleistocene era, 1–2 mya.[27] the first kangaroo to be exhibited in the western world was an example shot by john gore, an officer on captain cook's ship, the hms endeavour, in 1770.[28][29] the animal was shot and its skin and skull transported back to england whereupon it was stuffed (by taxidermists who had never seen the animal before) and displayed to the general public as a curiosity. the first glimpse of a kangaroo for many 18th-century britons was a painting by george stubbs.[30] kangaroos and wallabies belong to the same taxonomic family (macropodidae) and often the same genera, but kangaroos are specifically categorised into the four largest species of the family. the term wallaby is an informal designation generally used for any macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or a wallaroo that has not been designated otherwise.[3] kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. the comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (12–16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (43 mph) can be attained over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2 km (1.2 mi).[31] during a hop, the powerful gastrocnemius muscles lift the body off the ground while the smaller plantaris muscle, which attaches near the large fourth toe, is used for push-off. seventy percent of potential energy is stored in the elastic tendons.[32] at slow speeds, it employs pentapedal locomotion, using its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward. both pentapedal walking and fast hopping are energetically costly. hopping at moderate speeds is the most energy efficient, and a kangaroo moving above 15 km/h (9.3 mph) maintains energy consistency more than similarly sized animals running at the same speed.[27] kangaroos have single-chambered stomachs quite unlike those of cattle and sheep, which have four compartments.[33][34] they sometimes regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion. however, this is a different, more strenuous, activity than it is in ruminants, and does not take place as frequently.[35] different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. the eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, and eats a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species such as the red kangaroo include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. many species are nocturnal,[36] and crepuscular,[37][38] usually spending the hot days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding. because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth that are rare among mammals. its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass. since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. the silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out, and are replaced by new teeth that grow in the back.[39] this process is known as polyphyodonty and, amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees. despite having herbivorous diets similar to ruminants such as cattle, which release large quantities of digestive methane through exhaling and eructation (burping), kangaroos release virtually none. the hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate, which is then used to provide further energy. scientists are interested in the possibility of transferring the bacteria responsible for this process from kangaroos to cattle, since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times greater than carbon dioxide per molecule.[40] groups of kangaroos are called mobs, courts or troupes, which usually have 10 or more kangaroos in them. living in mobs can provide protection for some of the weaker members of the group.[18] the size and stability of mobs vary between geographic regions,[23] with eastern australia having larger and more stable aggregations than in arid areas farther west.[23] larger aggregations display high amounts of interactions and complex social structures, comparable to that of ungulates.[23] one common behavior is nose touching and sniffing, which mostly occurs when an individual joins a group.[27] the kangaroo performing the sniffing gains much information from smell cues. this behavior enforces social cohesion without consequent aggression. during mutual sniffing, if one kangaroo is smaller, it will hold its body closer to the ground and its head will quiver, which serves as a possible form of submission.[27] greetings between males and females are common, with larger males being the most involved in meeting females. most other non-antagonistic behavior occurs between mothers and their young. mother and young reinforce their bond through grooming. a mother will groom her young while it is suckling or after it is finished suckling.[27] a joey will nuzzle its mother's pouch if it wants access to it. sexual activity of kangaroos consists of consort pairs.[41] oestrous females roam widely and attract the attention of males with conspicuous signals.[41] a male will monitor a female and follow her every movement. he sniffs her urine to see if she is in oestrus, a process exhibiting the flehmen response. the male will then proceed to approach her slowly to avoid alarming her.[23] if the female does not run away, the male will continue by licking, pawing, and scratching her, and copulation will follow.[23] after copulation is over, the male will move on to another female. consort pairing may take several days and the copulation is also long. thus, a consort pair is likely to attract the attention of a rival male.[41] as larger males are tending bonds with females near oestrus, smaller males will tend to females that are farther from oestrus.[23] dominant males can avoid having to sort through females to determine their reproductive status by searching for tending bonds held by the largest male they can displace without a fight.[23] fighting has been described in all species of kangaroos. fights between kangaroos can be brief or long and ritualised.[27] in highly competitive situations, such as males fighting for access to oestrous females or at limited drinking spots, the fights are brief.[27] both sexes will fight for drinking spots, but long, ritualised fighting or ""boxing"" is largely done by males. smaller males fight more often near females in oestrus, while the large males in consorts do not seem to get involved. ritualised fights can arise suddenly when males are grazing together. however, most fights are preceded by two males scratching and grooming each other.[27] one or both of them will adopt a high standing posture, with one male issuing a challenge by grasping the other male's neck with its forepaw. sometimes, the challenge will be declined. large males often reject challenges by smaller males. during fighting, the combatants adopt a high standing posture and paw at each other's heads, shoulders and chests. they will also lock forearms and wrestle and push each other as well as balance on their tails to kick each other in the abdomen.[27] brief fights are similar, except there is no forearm locking. the losing combatant seems to use kicking more often, perhaps to parry the thrusts of the eventual winner. a winner is decided when a kangaroo breaks off the fight and retreats. winners are able to push their opponents backwards or down to the ground. they also seem to grasp their opponents when they break contact and push them away.[27] the initiators of the fights are usually the winners. these fights may serve to establish dominance hierarchies among males, as winners of fights have been seen to displace their opponent from resting sites later in the day.[27] dominant males may also pull grass to intimidate subordinate ones.[23] kangaroos have a few natural predators. the thylacine, considered by palaeontologists to have once been a major natural predator of the kangaroo, is now extinct. other extinct predators included the marsupial lion, megalania and wonambi. however, with the arrival of humans in australia at least 50,000 years ago and the introduction of the dingo about 5,000 years ago, kangaroos have had to adapt. wedge-tailed eagles and other raptors usually eat kangaroo carrion. goannas and other carnivorous reptiles also pose a danger to smaller kangaroo species when other food sources are lacking. along with dingoes, introduced species such as foxes, feral cats, and both domestic and feral dogs, pose a threat to kangaroo populations. kangaroos and wallabies are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if presented with the option. if pursued into the water, a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.[42] another defensive tactic described by witnesses is catching the attacking dog with the forepaws and disembowelling it with the hind legs. kangaroos have developed a number of adaptations to a dry, infertile country and highly variable climate. as with all marsupials, the young are born at a very early stage of development—after a gestation of 31–36 days. at this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat. in comparison, a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old, and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive. when the joey is born, it is about the size of a lima bean. the joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months (180–320 days for the western grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time. it is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months. the female kangaroo is usually pregnant in permanence, except on the day she gives birth; however, she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch. this is known as embryonic diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. the composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. in addition, the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in the pouch. unusually, during a dry period, males will not produce sperm, and females will conceive only if enough rain has fallen to produce a large quantity of green vegetation.[43] kangaroos and wallabies have large, elastic tendons in their hind legs. they store elastic strain energy in the tendons of their large hind legs, providing most of the energy required for each hop by the spring action of the tendons rather than by any muscular effort.[44] this is true in all animal species which have muscles connected to their skeletons through elastic elements such as tendons, but the effect is more pronounced in kangaroos. there is also a link between the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is expelled from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and the extra energy is required to carry extra weight. for kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators—the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped, and the australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other countries—but economy: in an infertile country with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival. new research has revealed that a kangaroo's tail acts as a third leg rather than just a balancing strut. kangaroos have a unique three-stage walk where they plant their front legs and tail first, then push off their tail, followed lastly by the back legs. the propulsive force of the tail is equal to that of both the front and hind legs combined and performs as much work as what a human leg walking can at the same speed.[45] a dna sequencing project of the genome of a member of the kangaroo family, the tammar wallaby, was started in 2004. it was a collaboration between australia (mainly funded by the state of victoria) and the national institutes of health in the us.[46] the tammar's genome was fully sequenced in 2011.[47] the genome of a marsupial such as the kangaroo is of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics, because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans: mice are too close and have not developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote. the dairy industry could also benefit from this project.[48] eye disease is rare but not new among kangaroos. the first official report of kangaroo blindness took place in 1994, in central new south wales. the following year, reports of blind kangaroos appeared in victoria and south australia. by 1996, the disease had spread ""across the desert to western australia"".[49] australian authorities were concerned the disease could spread to other livestock and possibly humans. researchers at the australian animal health laboratories in geelong detected a virus called the wallal virus in two species of midges, believed to have been the carriers.[50][51] veterinarians also discovered fewer than 3% of kangaroos exposed to the virus developed blindness.[49] kangaroo reproduction is similar to that of opossums. the egg (still contained in the shell membrane, a few micrometres thick, and with only a small quantity of yolk within it) descends from the ovary into the uterus. there it is fertilised and quickly develops into a neonate. even in the largest kangaroo species (the red kangaroo), the neonate emerges after only 33 days. usually, only one young is born at a time. it is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long; its hindlegs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's abdomen into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed. almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. this is known as embryonic diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. after about 190 days, the baby (joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. from then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after about 235 days, it leaves the pouch for the last time.[52] the lifespan of kangaroos averages at six years in the wild[53]to in excess of 20 years in captivity, varying by the species.[54] most individuals, however, do not reach maturity in the wild.[55][56] the kangaroo has always been a very important animal for aboriginal australians, for its meat, hide, bone, and tendon. kangaroo hides were also sometimes used for recreation; in particular there are accounts of some tribes (kurnai) using stuffed kangaroo scrotum as a ball for the traditional football game of marngrook. in addition, there were important dreaming stories and ceremonies involving the kangaroo. aherrenge is a current kangaroo dreaming site in the northern territory.[57] unlike many of the smaller macropods, kangaroos have fared well since european settlement. european settlers cut down forests to create vast grasslands for sheep and cattle grazing, added stock watering points in arid areas, and have substantially reduced the number of dingoes. kangaroos are shy and retiring by nature, and in normal circumstances present no threat to humans. in 2003, lulu, an eastern grey which had been hand-reared, saved a farmer's life by alerting family members to his location when he was injured by a falling tree branch. she received the rspca australia national animal valour award on 19 may 2004.[58][59][60] there are very few records of kangaroos attacking humans without provocation; however, several such unprovoked attacks in 2004 spurred fears of a rabies-like disease possibly affecting the marsupials. the only reliably documented case of a fatality from a kangaroo attack occurred in new south wales in 1936. a hunter was killed when he tried to rescue his two dogs from a heated fray. other suggested causes for erratic and dangerous kangaroo behaviour include extreme thirst and hunger. in july 2011, a male red kangaroo attacked a 94-year-old woman in her own backyard as well as her son and two police officers responding to the situation. the kangaroo was capsicum sprayed (pepper sprayed) and later put down after the attack.[61][62] kangaroos-even those that are non domesticated-[63] can communicate with humans, according to a research study. [63] [64] nine out of ten animal collisions in australia involve kangaroos. a collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo. kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise often leap in front of cars. since kangaroos in mid-bound can reach speeds of around 50 km/h (31 mph) and are relatively heavy, the force of impact can be severe. small vehicles may be destroyed, while larger vehicles may suffer engine damage. the risk of harm or death to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact. as a result, ""kangaroo crossing"" signs are commonplace in australia. vehicles that frequent isolated roads, where roadside assistance may be scarce, are often fitted with ""roo bars"" to minimise damage caused by collision. bonnet-mounted devices, designed to scare wildlife off the road with ultrasound and other methods, have been devised and marketed. if a female is the victim of a collision, animal welfare groups ask that her pouch be checked for any surviving joey, in which case it may be removed to a wildlife sanctuary or veterinary surgeon for rehabilitation. likewise, when an adult kangaroo is injured in a collision, a vet, the rspca australia or the national parks and wildlife service can be consulted for instructions on proper care. in new south wales, rehabilitation of kangaroos is carried out by volunteers from wires. council road signs often list phone numbers for callers to report injured animals. the kangaroo is a recognisable symbol of australia. the kangaroo and emu feature on the australian coat of arms. kangaroos have also been featured on coins, most notably the five kangaroos on the australian one dollar coin. the australian made logo consists of a golden kangaroo in a green triangle to show that a product is grown or made in australia. registered trademarks of early australian companies using the kangaroo included yung, schollenberger & co. walla walla brand leather and skins (1890); arnold v. henn (1892) whose emblem showed a family of kangaroos playing with a skipping rope; robert lascelles & co. linked the speed of the animal with its velocipedes (1896); while some overseas manufacturers, like that of ""the kangaroo"" safety matches (made in japan) of the early 1900s, also adopted the symbol. even today, australia's national airline, qantas, uses a bounding kangaroo for its logo.[65] the kangaroo and wallaby feature predominantly in australian sports teams names and mascots. examples include the australian national rugby league team (the kangaroos) and the australian national rugby union team (the wallabies). in a nation-wide competition held in 1978 for the xii commonwealth games by the games australia foundation limited in 1982, hugh edwards' design was chosen; a simplified form of six thick stripes arranged in pairs extending from along the edges of a triangular centre represent both the kangaroo in full flight, and a stylised ""a"" for australia.[65] kangaroos are well represented in films, television, books, toys and souvenirs around the world. skippy the bush kangaroo was a popular 1960s australian children's television series about a fictional pet kangaroo. kangaroos are featured in the rolf harris song ""tie me kangaroo down, sport"" and several christmas carols. the kangaroo has been a source of food for indigenous australians for tens of thousands of years. kangaroo meat is high in protein and low in fat (about 2%). kangaroo meat has a high concentration of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) compared with other foods, and is a rich source of vitamins and minerals.[66] low fat diets rich in cla have been studied for their potential in reducing obesity and atherosclerosis.[67][68] kangaroo meat is sourced from wild animals and is seen by many as the best source of population control programs[69] as opposed to culling them as pests where carcasses are left in paddocks. kangaroos are harvested by highly skilled, licensed shooters in accordance with a strict code of practice and are protected by state and federal legislation.[70][71] kangaroo meat is exported to many countries around the world. "
horse," at least 48 published the horse (equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is one of two extant subspecies of equus ferus. it is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family equidae. the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. humans began domesticating horses around 4000 bc, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 bc. horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. these feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. there is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.[4] female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. they reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited ""hot bloods"" with speed and endurance; ""cold bloods"", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and ""warmbloods"", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in europe. there are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses. horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers. specific terms and specialized language are used to describe equine anatomy, different life stages, and colors and breeds. depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years.[7] uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.[8] the oldest verifiable record was ""old billy"", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.[7] in modern times, sugar puff, who had been listed in guinness world records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.[9] regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each january 1 of each year in the northern hemisphere[7][10] and each august 1 in the southern hemisphere.[11] the exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.[12] the following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages: in horse racing, these definitions may differ: for example, in the british isles, thoroughbred horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old.[21] however, australian thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old.[22] the height of horses is measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back.[23] this point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse. in english-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches: one hand is equal to 4 inches (101.6 mm). the height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a point, then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation ""h"" or ""hh"" (for ""hands high""). thus, a horse described as ""15.2 h"" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of 62 inches (157.5 cm) in height.[24] the size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition. light riding horses usually range in height from 14 to 16 hands (56 to 64 inches, 142 to 163 cm) and can weigh from 380 to 550 kilograms (840 to 1,210 lb).[25] larger riding horses usually start at about 15.2 hands (62 inches, 157 cm) and often are as tall as 17 hands (68 inches, 173 cm), weighing from 500 to 600 kilograms (1,100 to 1,320 lb).[26] heavy or draft horses are usually at least 16 hands (64 inches, 163 cm) high and can be as tall as 18 hands (72 inches, 183 cm) high. they can weigh from about 700 to 1,000 kilograms (1,540 to 2,200 lb).[27] the largest horse in recorded history was probably a shire horse named mammoth, who was born in 1848. he stood 21.2 1⁄4 hands (86.25 inches, 219 cm) high and his peak weight was estimated at 1,524 kilograms (3,360 lb).[28] the current record holder for the world's smallest horse is thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism. she is 17 in (43 cm) tall and weighs 57 lb (26 kg).[29] ponies are taxonomically the same animals as horses. the distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes. however, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament. the traditional standard for height of a horse or a pony at maturity is 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm). an animal 14.2 h or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.2 h a pony,[30] but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard. in australia, ponies are considered to be those under 14 hands (56 inches, 142 cm).[31] for competition in the western division of the united states equestrian federation, the cutoff is 14.1 hands (57 inches, 145 cm).[32] the international federation for equestrian sports, the world governing body for horse sport, uses metric measurements and defines a pony as being any horse measuring less than 148 centimetres (58.27 in) at the withers without shoes, which is just over 14.2 h, and 149 centimetres (58.66 in), or just over 14.2​1⁄2 h, with shoes.[33] height is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies. breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2 h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height.[34] conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2 h, but are still considered to be ponies.[35] ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat. they also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. they may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers.[30] small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. for example, the shetland pony which averages 10 hands (40 inches, 102 cm), is considered a pony.[30] conversely, breeds such as the falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than 30 inches (76 cm), are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.[36] horses have 64 chromosomes.[37] the horse genome was sequenced in 2007. it contains 2.7 billion dna base pairs,[38] which is larger than the dog genome, but smaller than the human genome or the bovine genome.[39] the map is available to researchers.[40] horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex.[41] horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings,[42] which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.[43] many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color,[44] and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. the basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the melanocortin 1 receptor,[45] also known as the ""extension gene"" or ""red factor,""[44] as its recessive form is ""red"" (chestnut) and its dominant form is black.[46] additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as graying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.[44] horses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks ""white"" is usually a middle-aged or older gray. grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white markings). the only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence.[46] different and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino-1 gene.[47] however, there are no ""albino"" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes.[48] gestation lasts approximately 340 days, with an average range 320–370 days,[49] and usually results in one foal; twins are rare.[50] horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth.[51] foals are usually born in the spring. the estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period.[52] foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.[53] horses, particularly colts, sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 18 months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.[54] horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. these plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.[55] depending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and trained to be ridden between the ages of two and four.[56] although thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries,[57] horses specifically bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed.[58] for endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60 calendar months (five years) old.[12] the horse skeleton averages 205 bones.[59] a significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone—the horse's forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso. the horse's four legs and hooves are also unique structures. their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. for example, the body part that is called a horse's ""knee"" is actually made up of the carpal bones that correspond to the human wrist. similarly, the hock contains bones equivalent to those in the human ankle and heel. the lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the fetlock (incorrectly called the ""ankle"") is actually the proximal sesamoid bones between the cannon bones (a single equivalent to the human metacarpal or metatarsal bones) and the proximal phalanges, located where one finds the ""knuckles"" of a human. a horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof.[60] the critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, ""no foot, no horse"".[61] the horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges, the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by cartilage and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the laminae. the exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of keratin, the same material as a human fingernail.[62] the end result is that a horse, weighing on average 500 kilograms (1,100 lb),[63] travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe.[64] for the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier. the hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks,[65] though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain. horses are adapted to grazing. in an adult horse, there are 12 incisors at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation. there are 24 teeth adapted for chewing, the premolars and molars, at the back of the mouth. stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of canine teeth called ""tushes"". some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small vestigial teeth in front of the molars, known as ""wolf"" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the bit. there is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or ""bars"" of the horse's mouth when the horse is bridled.[66] an estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its teeth. the teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. this allows a very rough estimate of a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.[7] horses are herbivores with a digestive system adapted to a forage diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. a 450-kilogram (990 lb) horse will eat 7 to 11 kilograms (15 to 24 lb) of food per day and, under normal use, drink 38 to 45 litres (8.4 to 9.9 imp gal; 10 to 12 us gal) of water. horses are not ruminants, they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can utilize cellulose, a major component of grass. horses are hindgut fermenters. cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria occurs in the cecum, or ""water gut"", which food goes through before reaching the large intestine. horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause colic, a leading cause of death.[67] the horses' senses are based on their status as prey animals, where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times.[68] they have the largest eyes of any land mammal,[69] and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads.[70] this means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision.[69] horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.[71] their sense of smell, while much better than that of humans, is not quite as good as that of a dog. it is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. horses have two olfactory centers. the first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. the second, located under the nasal cavity, are the vomeronasal organs, also called jacobson's organs. these have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.[72] a horse's hearing is good,[68] and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the potential for 360° hearing without having to move the head.[73] noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: a 2013 study in the uk indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. this study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels.[74] an australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had a higher rate of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.[75] horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times.[76] a horse's sense of touch is well-developed. the most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose.[77] horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.[78] horses have an advanced sense of taste, which allows them to sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat,[79] and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.[80] walk 5–8 km/h (3.1–5.0 mph) trot 8–13 km/h (5.0–8.1 mph) pace 8–13 km/h (5.0–8.1 mph) canter 16–27 km/h (9.9–16.8 mph) gallop 40–48 km/h (25–30 mph), record: 70.76 km/h (43.97 mph) all horses move naturally with four basic gaits: the four-beat walk, which averages 6.4 kilometres per hour (4.0 mph); the two-beat trot or jog at 13 to 19 kilometres per hour (8.1 to 11.8 mph) (faster for harness racing horses); the canter or lope, a three-beat gait that is 19 to 24 kilometres per hour (12 to 15 mph); and the gallop.[81] the gallop averages 40 to 48 kilometres per hour (25 to 30 mph),[82] but the world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is 70.76 kilometres per hour (43.97 mph).[83] besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot.[84] there also are several four-beat ""ambling"" gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace, though smoother to ride. these include the lateral rack, running walk, and tölt as well as the diagonal fox trot.[85] ambling gaits are often genetic in some breeds, known collectively as gaited horses.[86] often, gaited horses replace the trot with one of the ambling gaits.[87] horses are prey animals with a strong fight-or-flight response. their first reaction to a threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened.[88] they also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. however, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.[89] horses are herd animals, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare. they are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. they communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual grooming, and body language. many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses.[90] however, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop stable vices, an assortment of bad habits, mostly stereotypies of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, ""weaving"" (rocking back and forth), and other problems.[91] studies have indicated that horses perform a number of cognitive tasks on a daily basis, meeting mental challenges that include food procurement and identification of individuals within a social system. they also have good spatial discrimination abilities.[92] they are naturally curious and apt to investigate things they have not seen before.[93] studies have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as problem solving, speed of learning, and memory. horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve categorization and concept learning. they can learn using habituation, desensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning, and positive and negative reinforcement.[92] one study has indicated that horses can differentiate between ""more or less"" if the quantity involved is less than four.[94] domesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that prevent instinctive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural.[92] horses are animals of habit that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. one trainer believes that ""intelligent"" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal's natural inclinations.[95] horses are mammals, and as such are warm-blooded, or endothermic creatures, as opposed to cold-blooded, or poikilothermic animals. however, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not body temperature. for example, the ""hot-bloods"", such as many race horses, exhibit more sensitivity and energy,[96] while the ""cold-bloods"", such as most draft breeds, are quieter and calmer.[97] sometimes ""hot-bloods"" are classified as ""light horses"" or ""riding horses"",[98] with the ""cold-bloods"" classified as ""draft horses"" or ""work horses"".[99] ""hot blooded"" breeds include ""oriental horses"" such as the akhal-teke, arabian horse, barb and now-extinct turkoman horse, as well as the thoroughbred, a breed developed in england from the older oriental breeds.[96] hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly. they are bred for agility and speed.[100] they tend to be physically refined—thin-skinned, slim, and long-legged.[101] the original oriental breeds were brought to europe from the middle east and north africa when european breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light cavalry horses.[102][103] muscular, heavy draft horses are known as ""cold bloods"", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people.[97] they are sometimes nicknamed ""gentle giants"".[104] well-known draft breeds include the belgian and the clydesdale.[104] some, like the percheron, are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates.[105] others, such as the shire, are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils.[106] the cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.[107] ""warmblood"" breeds, such as the trakehner or hanoverian, developed when european carriage and war horses were crossed with arabians or thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed.[108] certain pony breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.[109] warmbloods are considered a ""light horse"" or ""riding horse"".[98] today, the term ""warmblood"" refers to a specific subset of sport horse breeds that are used for competition in dressage and show jumping.[110] strictly speaking, the term ""warm blood"" refers to any cross between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds.[111] examples include breeds such as the irish draught or the cleveland bay. the term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than thoroughbreds or arabians, such as the morgan horse.[100] horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. in an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a ""stay apparatus"" in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing.[112] horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. a horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.[113] unlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours,[113] mostly in short intervals of about 15 minutes each.[114] the average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.[115] horses must lie down to reach rem sleep. they only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum rem sleep requirements.[113] however, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into rem sleep while still standing.[116] this condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.[117] the horse adapted to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not.[118] horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the tertiary period. in the past, this order contained 14 families, but only three—equidae (the horse and related species), tapiridae (the tapir), and rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.[119] the earliest known member of the family equidae was the hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55 million years ago, during the eocene period. it had 4 toes on each front foot, and 3 toes on each back foot.[120] the extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37 million years ago.[121] over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. all that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee,[122] known informally as splint bones.[123] their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed.[122] by about 5 million years ago, the modern equus had evolved.[124] equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of eurasia and the great plains of north america. by about 15,000 years ago, equus ferus was a widespread holarctic species. horse bones from this time period, the late pleistocene, are found in europe, eurasia, beringia, and north america.[125] yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in north america and rare elsewhere.[126][127][128] the reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in north america paralleled human arrival.[129] another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.[130] a truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated. therefore, most ""wild"" horses today are actually feral horses, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals.[131] only two never-domesticated subspecies, the tarpan and the przewalski's horse, survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today. the przewalski's horse (equus ferus przewalskii), named after the russian explorer nikolai przhevalsky, is a rare asian animal. it is also known as the mongolian wild horse; mongolian people know it as the taki, and the kyrgyz people call it a kirtag. the subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. in 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos.[132] today, a small wild breeding population exists in mongolia.[133][134] there are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world. the tarpan or european wild horse (equus ferus ferus) was found in europe and much of asia. it survived into the historical era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a russian zoo.[135] thus, the genetic line was lost. attempts have been made to recreate the tarpan,[135][136][137] which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses. periodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic. for example, the riwoche horse of tibet was proposed as such,[134] but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses.[138] similarly, the sorraia of portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the tarpan based on shared characteristics,[139][140] but genetic studies have shown that the sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.[139][141] besides the horse, there are six other species of genus equus in the equidae family. these are the ass or donkey, equus asinus; the mountain zebra, equus zebra; plains zebra, equus quagga; grévy's zebra, equus grevyi; the kiang, equus kiang; and the onager, equus hemionus.[142] horses can crossbreed with other members of their genus. the most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a ""jack"" (male donkey) and a mare. a related hybrid, a hinny, is a cross between a stallion and a jenny (female donkey).[143] other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse.[144] with rare exceptions, most hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce.[145] domestication of the horse most likely took place in central asia prior to 3500 bc. two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. the first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of dna obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains. the earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in ukraine and kazakhstan, dating to approximately 3500–4000 bc.[146][147][148] by 3000 bc, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 bc there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent.[149] the most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the sintashta and petrovka cultures c. 2100 bc.[150] domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. the variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse,[151][152] while many mares were part of early domesticated herds.[141][153][154] this is reflected in the difference in genetic variation between the dna that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial dna). there are very low levels of y-chromosome variability,[151][152] but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial dna.[141][153][154] there is also regional variation in mitochondrial dna due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds.[141][153][154][155] another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation.[156] in horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 bc.[157] before the availability of dna techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. one classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication.[107] another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication.[158] however, the lack of a detectable substructure in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses. feral horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals.[131] many populations of feral horses exist throughout the world.[159][160] studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses,[161] as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.[162] there are also semi-feral horses in many parts of the world, such as dartmoor and the new forest in the uk, where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in ""wild"" conditions on undeveloped, often public, lands. owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights.[163][164] the concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called ""thoroughbreds"". thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a ""purebred"" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry.[165] horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. these inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods. horses have been selectively bred since their domestication. an early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the bedouin, who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.[166] these pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition.[167] in the 14th century, carthusian monks of southern spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the andalusian horse.[168] breeds developed due to a need for ""form to function"", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work.[169] thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage.[169] heavy draft horses were developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons.[170] other horse breeds had been developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets.[171] some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. one of the earliest formal registries was general stud book for thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed.[172] there are more than 300 horse breeds in the world today.[173] worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. the food and agriculture organization (fao) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the americas, 13,800,000 in asia and 6,300,000 in europe and smaller portions in africa and oceania. there are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the united states alone.[174] the american horse council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the united states of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.[175] in a 2004 ""poll"" conducted by animal planet, more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.[176] communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity;[177] to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control.[178] sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle,[179] and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear.[180] many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.[181] historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. many sports, such as dressage, eventing and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques.[177] horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. all forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. the popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.[177] horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. examples include show jumping, dressage, three-day eventing, competitive driving, endurance riding, gymkhana, rodeos, and fox hunting.[182] horse shows, which have their origins in medieval european fairs, are held around the world. they host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as ""in-hand"" classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. the method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.[183] sports such as polo do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task.[184] examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,[185] and buzkashi, a team game played throughout central asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.[184] horse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. there are three types: ""flat"" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky.[186] a major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it.[187] there are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. for example, mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control.[188] cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain.[189] search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance.[190] horses can also be used in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. they may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.[191] although machinery has replaced horses in many parts of the world, an estimated 100 million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. this number includes around 27 million working animals in africa alone.[192] some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. in agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses.[193][194] logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.[195] horses have been used in warfare for most of recorded history. the first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 bc,[196] and the use of horses in warfare was widespread by the end of the bronze age.[197][198] although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. horses have been used in the 21st century by the janjaweed militias in the war in darfur.[199] modern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes. horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles.[200] horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. countries such as the united kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other vips to and from certain culturally significant events.[201] public exhibitions are another example, such as the budweiser clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar to that used before the invention of the modern motorized truck.[202] horses are frequently used in television, films and literature. they are sometimes featured as a major character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories.[203] both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products.[204] the horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, in a variety of poses and equipment.[205] the mythologies of many cultures, including greco-roman, hindu, islamic, and norse, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the moon and sun.[206] the horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the chinese zodiac related to the chinese calendar.[207] people of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from an association with horses. therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence.[208] the benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the paralympic games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the international federation for equestrian sports (fei).[209] hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. in hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.[210] horses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. ""equine-assisted"" or ""equine-facilitated"" therapy is a form of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes.[211] there are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.[212] horses are raw material for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses. products collected from living horses include mare's milk, used by people with large horse herds, such as the mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis.[213] horse blood was once used as food by the mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. drinking their own horses' blood allowed the mongols to ride for extended periods of time without stopping to eat.[213] the drug premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy.[214] the tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.[215] horse meat has been used as food for humans and carnivorous animals throughout the ages. approximately 5 million horses are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.[216] it is eaten in many parts of the world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures,[217] and a subject of political controversy in others.[218] horsehide leather has been used for boots, gloves, jackets,[219] baseballs,[220] and baseball gloves. horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue.[221] horse bones can be used to make implements.[222] specifically, in italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures.[223] in asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.[224] horses are grazing animals, and their major source of nutrients is good-quality forage from hay or pasture.[225] they can consume approximately 2% to 2.5% of their body weight in dry feed each day. therefore, a 450-kilogram (990 lb) adult horse could eat up to 11 kilograms (24 lb) of food.[226] sometimes, concentrated feed such as grain is fed in addition to pasture or hay, especially when the animal is very active.[227] when grain is fed, equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal's diet by weight should still be forage.[228] horses require a plentiful supply of clean water, a minimum of 10 us gallons (38 l) to 12 us gallons (45 l) per day.[229] although horses are adapted to live outside, they require shelter from the wind and precipitation, which can range from a simple shed or shelter to an elaborate stable.[230] horses require routine hoof care from a farrier, as well as vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental examinations from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist.[231] if horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being.[232] when turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained.[233] regular grooming is also helpful to help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.[234] "
monkey," mangaon, maharashtra, india monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals, in part, the simians of infraorder simiiformes. the term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of new world monkeys and old world monkeys. many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the old world monkeys of catarrhini. simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago. new world monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago. old world monkeys and hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago. extinct basal simians such as aegyptopithecus or parapithecus [35-32 million years ago], eosimiidea and sometimes even the catarrhini group are also considered monkeys by primatologists.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9] lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates. like monkeys, tarsiers are haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys. apes emerged within ""monkeys"" as sister of the cercopithecidae in the catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. there has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so ""old world monkey"" may be taken to mean the cercopithecoidea or the catarrhini.[10][11][12][13][14][15][9][16][17][18] that apes are monkeys was already realized by georges-louis leclerc, comte de buffon in the 18th century.[19] monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.[20][better source needed] according to the online etymology dictionary, the word ""monkey"" may originate in a german version of the reynard the fox fable, published circa 1580. in this version of the fable, a character named moneke is the son of martin the ape.[21] in english, no very clear distinction was originally made between ""ape"" and ""monkey""; thus the 1911 encyclopædia britannica entry for ""ape"" notes that it is either a synonym for ""monkey"" or is used to mean a tailless humanlike primate.[22] colloquially, the terms ""monkey"" and ""ape"" are widely used interchangeably.[23] also, a few monkey species have the word ""ape"" in their common name, such as the barbary ape. later in the first half of the 20th century, the idea developed that there were trends in primate evolution and that the living members of the order could be arranged in a series, leading through ""monkeys"" and ""apes"" to humans.[24] monkeys thus constituted a ""grade"" on the path to humans and were distinguished from ""apes"". scientific classifications are now more often based on monophyletic groups, that is groups consisting of all the descendants of a common ancestor. the new world monkeys and the old world monkeys are each monophyletic groups, but their combination was not, since it excluded hominoids (apes and humans). thus the term ""monkey"" no longer referred to a recognized scientific taxon. the smallest accepted taxon which contains all the monkeys is the infraorder simiiformes, or simians. however this also contains the hominoids, so that monkeys are, in terms of currently recognized taxa, non-hominoid simians. colloquially and pop-culturally, the term is ambiguous and sometimes monkey includes non-human hominoids.[25] in addition, frequent arguments are made for a monophyletic usage of the word ""monkey"" from the perspective that usage should reflect cladistics.[26][27][28][29][30] a group of monkeys may be commonly referred to as a tribe or a troop.[31] two separate groups of primates are referred to as ""monkeys"": new world monkeys (platyrrhines) from south and central america and old world monkeys (catarrhines in the superfamily cercopithecoidea) from africa and asia. apes (hominoids)—consisting of gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans—are also catarrhines but were classically distinguished from monkeys.[32][33][34][35] (tailless monkeys may be called ""apes"", incorrectly according to modern usage; thus the tailless barbary macaque is sometimes called the ""barbary ape"".) as apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well. williams et al outlined evolutionary features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes.[36] monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight,[37] to the male mandrill, almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb).[38] some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).[39] some characteristics are shared among the groups; most new world monkeys have prehensile tails while old world monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all. old world monkeys have trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while new world monkeys may be trichromatic, dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic. although both the new and old world monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of old world and new world monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the types of noses, cheeks and rumps.[39] the following list shows where the various monkey families (bolded) are placed in the classification of living (extant) primates. below is a cladogram with some extinct monkey families.[40][41][42] generally, extinct non-hominoid simians, including early catarrhines are discussed as monkeys as well as simians or anthropoids,[32][33][34] which cladistically means that hominoidea are monkeys as well, restoring monkeys as a single grouping. it is indicated approximately how many million years ago (mya) the clades diverged into newer clades.[43][44][45][46] it is thought the new world monkeys started as a drifted ""old world monkey"" group from the old world (probably africa) to the new world (south america).[33] tarsiiformes eosimiidae s.s.

organisms in laboratories or in space missions. they may be killed in monkey drives (when they threaten agriculture) or used as service animals for the disabled. in some areas, some species of monkey are considered agricultural pests, and can cause extensive damage to commercial and subsistence crops.[47][48] this can have important implications for the conservation of endangered species, which may be subject to persecution. in some instances farmers' perceptions of the damage may exceed the actual damage.[49] monkeys that have become habituated to human presence in tourist locations may also be considered pests, attacking tourists.[50] in popular culture monkeys are a symbol of playfulness, mischief and fun.[51][circular reference] some organizations train capuchin monkeys as service animals to assist quadriplegics and other people with severe spinal cord injuries or mobility impairments. after being socialized in a human home as infants, the monkeys undergo extensive training before being placed with disabled people. around the house, the monkeys assist with daily tasks such as feeding, fetching, manipulating objects, and personal care.[52] helper monkeys are usually trained in schools by private organizations, taking seven years to train, and are able to serve 25–30 years (two to three times longer than a guide dog).[53] in 2010, the u.s. federal government revised its definition of service animal under the americans with disabilities act (ada). non-human primates are no longer recognized as service animals under the ada.[54] the american veterinary medical association does not support the use of non-human primates as assistance animals because of animal welfare concerns, the potential for serious injury to people, and risks that primates may transfer dangerous diseases to humans.[55] the most common monkey species found in animal research are the grivet, the rhesus macaque, and the crab-eating macaque, which are either wild-caught or purpose-bred.[56][57] they are used primarily because of their relative ease of handling, their fast reproductive cycle (compared to apes) and their psychological and physical similarity to humans. worldwide, it is thought that between 100,000 and 200,000 non-human primates are used in research each year,[57] 64.7% of which are old world monkeys, and 5.5% new world monkeys.[58] this number makes a very small fraction of all animals used in research.[57] between 1994 and 2004 the united states has used an average of 54,000 non-human primates, while around 10,000 non-human primates were used in the european union in 2002.[58] a number of countries have used monkeys as part of their space exploration programmes, including the united states and france. the first monkey in space was albert ii, who flew in the us-launched v-2 rocket on june 14, 1949.[59] monkey brains are eaten as a delicacy in parts of south asia, africa and china.[60] monkeys are sometimes eaten in parts of africa, where they can be sold as ""bushmeat"". in traditional islamic dietary laws, the eating of monkeys is forbidden.[61] sun wukong (the ""monkey king""), a character who figures prominently in chinese mythology, is the protagonist in the classic comic chinese novel journey to the west. monkeys are prevalent in numerous books, television programs, and movies. the television series monkey and the literary characters monsieur eek and curious george are all examples. informally, ""monkey"" may refer to apes, particularly chimpanzees, gibbons, and gorillas. author terry pratchett alludes to this difference in usage in his discworld novels, in which the librarian of the unseen university is an orangutan who gets very violent if referred to as a monkey. another example is the use of simians in chinese poetry. the winged monkeys are prominent characters in l. frank baum's wizard of oz books and in the 1939 film based on baum's 1900 novel the wonderful wizard of oz. monkey is the symbol of fourth tirthankara in jainism, abhinandananatha.[62][63] hanuman, a prominent deity in hinduism, is a human-like monkey god who is believed to bestow courage, strength and longevity to the person who thinks about him or rama. in buddhism, the monkey is an early incarnation of buddha but may also represent trickery and ugliness. the chinese buddhist ""mind monkey"" metaphor refers to the unsettled, restless state of human mind. monkey is also one of the three senseless creatures, symbolizing greed, with the tiger representing anger and the deer lovesickness. the sanzaru, or three wise monkeys, are revered in japanese folklore; together they embody the proverbial principle to ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"".[64] the moche people of ancient peru worshipped nature.[65] they placed emphasis on animals and often depicted monkeys in their art.[66] the tzeltal people of mexico worshipped monkeys as incarnations of their dead ancestors. the monkey (猴) is the ninth in the twelve-year cycle of animals which appear in the chinese zodiac related to the chinese calendar. the next time that the monkey will appear as the zodiac sign will be in the year 2028.[67]"
owl," strigidae tytonidae ogygoptyngidae (fossil) palaeoglaucidae (fossil) protostrigidae (fossil) sophiornithidae (fossil) strigidae sensu sibley & ahlquist owls are birds from the order strigiformes /ˈstrɪdʒɪfɔːrmiːz/, which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl. owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. they are found in all regions of the earth except the polar ice caps and some remote islands. owls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, strigidae, and the barn-owl family, tytonidae. a group of owls is called a ""parliament.""[1] owls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye. the feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls' asymmetrically placed ear cavities. most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads, but the stereoscopic nature of the owl's forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting. although owls have binocular vision, their large eyes are fixed in their sockets—as are those of most other birds—so they must turn their entire heads to change views. as owls are farsighted, they are unable to clearly see anything within a few centimeters of their eyes. caught prey can be felt by owls with the use of filoplumes—hairlike feathers on the beak and feet that act as ""feelers"". their far vision, particularly in low light, is exceptionally good. owls can rotate their heads and necks as much as 270°. owls have 14 neck vertebrae compared to seven in humans, which makes their necks more flexible. they also have adaptations to their circulatory systems, permitting rotation without cutting off blood to the brain: the foramina in their vertebrae through which the vertebral arteries pass are about 10 times the diameter of the artery, instead of about the same size as the artery as in humans; the vertebral arteries enter the cervical vertebrae higher than in other birds, giving the vessels some slack, and the carotid arteries unite in a very large anastomosis or junction, the largest of any bird's, preventing blood supply from being cut off while they rotate their necks. other anastomoses between the carotid and vertebral arteries support this effect.[2][3] the smallest owl—weighing as little as 31 g (1 3⁄32 oz) and measuring some 13.5 cm (5 1⁄4 in)—is the elf owl (micrathene whitneyi).[4] around the same diminutive length, although slightly heavier, are the lesser known long-whiskered owlet (xenoglaux loweryi) and tamaulipas pygmy owl (glaucidium sanchezi).[4] the largest owls are two similarly sized eagle owls; the eurasian eagle-owl (bubo bubo) and blakiston's fish owl (bubo blakistoni). the largest females of these species are 71 cm (28 in) long, have a 190 cm (75 in) wing span, and weigh 4.2 kg (9 1⁄4 lb).[4][5][6][7][8] different species of owls produce different sounds; this distribution of calls aids owls in finding mates or announcing their presence to potential competitors, and also aids ornithologists and birders in locating these birds and distinguishing species. as noted above, their facial discs help owls to funnel the sound of prey to their ears. in many species, these discs are placed asymmetrically, for better directional location. owl plumage is generally cryptic, although several species have facial and head markings, including face masks, ear tufts, and brightly coloured irises. these markings are generally more common in species inhabiting open habitats, and are thought to be used in signaling with other owls in low-light conditions.[9] sexual dimorphism is a physical difference between males and females of a species. females owls are typically larger than the males.[10] the degree of size dimorphism varies across multiple populations and species, and is measured through various traits, such as wing span and body mass.[10] overall, female owls tend to be slightly larger than males. the exact explanation for this development in owls is unknown. however, several theories explain the development of sexual dimorphism in owls. one theory suggests that selection has led males to be smaller because it allows them to be efficient foragers. the ability to obtain more food is advantageous during breeding season. in some species, female owls stay at their nest with their eggs while it is the responsibility of the male to bring back food to the nest.[11] however, if food is scarce, the male first feeds himself before feeding the female.[12] small birds, which are agile, are an important source of food for owls. male burrowing owls have been observed to have longer wing chords than females, despite being smaller than females.[12] furthermore, owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey.[12] this has also been observed in other predatory birds,[11] which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.[citation needed] another popular theory suggests that females have not been selected to be smaller like male owls because of their sexual roles. in many species, female owls may not leave the nest. therefore, females may have a larger mass to allow them to go for a longer period of time without starving. for example, one hypothesized sexual role is that larger females are more capable of dismembering prey and feeding it to their young, hence female owls are larger than their male counterparts.[10] a different theory suggests that the size difference between male and females is due to sexual selection: since large females can choose their mate and may violently reject a male's sexual advances, smaller male owls that have the ability to escape unreceptive females are more likely to have been selected.[12] if the character is stable, there can be different optimums for both sexes. selection operates on both sexes at the same time; therefore it is necessary to explain not only why one of the sexes is relatively bigger, but also why the other sex is smaller.[13] if owls are still evolving towards smaller bodies and longer wing chords, according to v. geodakyan’s evolutionary theory of sex, males should be more advanced on these characters. males are viewed as an evolutionary vanguard of a population, and sexual dimorphism on the character, as an evolutionary “distance” between the sexes. “phylogenetic rule of sexual dimorphism” states that if there exists a sexual dimorphism on any character, then the evolution of this trait goes from the female form towards the male one.[14] all owls are carnivorous birds of prey and live mainly on a diet of insects and small rodents such as mice, rats, and hares. some owls are also specifically adapted to hunt fish. they are very adept in hunting in their respective environments. since owls can be found in nearly all parts of the world and across a multitude of ecosystems, their hunting skills and characteristics vary slightly from species to species, though most characteristics are shared among all species.[citation needed] most owls share an innate ability to fly almost silently and also more slowly in comparison to other birds of prey. most owls live a mainly nocturnal lifestyle and being able to fly without making any noise gives them a strong advantage over their prey that are listening for the slightest sound in the night. a silent, slow flight is not as necessary for diurnal and crepuscular owls given that prey can usually see an owl approaching. owls’ feathers are generally larger than the average birds’ feathers, have fewer radiates, longer pennulum, and achieve smooth edges with different rachis structures.[15] serrated edges along the owl's remiges bring the flapping of the wing down to a nearly silent mechanism. the serrations are more likely reducing aerodynamic disturbances, rather than simply reducing noise.[16] the surface of the flight feathers is covered with a velvety structure that absorbs the sound of the wing moving. these unique structures reduce noise frequencies above 2 khz,[17] making the sound level emitted drop below the typical hearing spectrum of the owl's usual prey[17][18] and also within the owl's own best hearing range.[19][20] this optimizes the owl's ability to silently fly to capture prey without the prey hearing the owl first as it flies in. it also allows the owl to monitor the sound output from its flight pattern. the feather adaption that allows silent flight means that barn owl feathers are not waterproof. to retain the softness and silent flight, the barn owl cannot use the preen oil or powder dust that other species use for waterproofing. in wet weather, they cannot hunt and this may be disastrous during the breeding season. barn owls are frequently found drowned in livestock drinking troughs, since they land to drink and bathe, but are unable to climb out. owls can struggle to keep warm, because of their lack of waterproofing, so large numbers of downy feathers help them to retain body heat.[21] eyesight is a particular characteristic of the owl that aids in nocturnal prey capture. owls are part of a small group of birds that live nocturnally, but do not use echolocation to guide them in flight in low-light situations. owls are known for their disproportionally large eyes in comparison to their skulls. an apparent consequence of the evolution of an absolutely large eye in a relatively small skull is that the eye of the owl has become tubular in shape. this shape is found in other so-called nocturnal eyes, such as the eyes of strepsirrhine primates and bathypelagic fishes.[22] since the eyes are fixed into these sclerotic tubes, they are unable to move the eyes in any direction.[23] instead of moving their eyes, owls swivel their heads to view their surroundings. owls' heads are capable of swiveling through an angle of roughly 270°, easily enabling them to see behind them without relocating the torso.[23] this ability keeps bodily movement at a minimum, thus reduces the amount of sound the owl makes as it waits for its prey. owls are regarded as having the most frontally placed eyes among all avian groups, which gives them some of the largest binocular fields of vision. however, owls are farsighted and cannot focus on objects within a few centimeters of their eyes.[22][24] these mechanisms are only able to function due to the large-sized retinal image.[25] thus, the primary nocturnal function in the vision of the owl is due to its large posterior nodal distance; retinal image brightness is only maximized to the owl within secondary neural functions.[25] these attributes of the owl cause its nocturnal eyesight to be far superior to that of its average prey.[25] owls exhibit specialized hearing functions and ear shapes that also aid in hunting. they are noted for asymmetrical ear placements on the skull in some genera. owls can have either internal or external ears, both of which are asymmetrical. asymmetry has not been reported to extend to the middle or internal ear of the owl. asymmetrical ear placement on the skull allows the owl to pinpoint the location of its prey. this is especially true for strictly nocturnal species such as the barn owls tyto or tengmalm's owl.[23] with ears set at different places on its skull, an owl is able to determine the direction from which the sound is coming by the minute difference in time that it takes for the sound waves to penetrate the left and right ears.[2] the owl turns its head until the sound reaches both ears at the same time, at which point it is directly facing the source of the sound. this time difference between ears is about 30 microseconds. behind the ear openings are modified, dense feathers, densely packed to form a facial ruff, which creates an anterior-facing, concave wall that cups the sound into the ear structure.[26] this facial ruff is poorly defined in some species, and prominent, nearly encircling the face, in other species. the facial disk also acts to direct sound into the ears, and a downward-facing, sharply triangular beak minimizes sound reflection away from the face. the shape of the facial disk is adjustable at will to focus sounds more effectively.[23] the prominences above a great horned owl's head are commonly mistaken as its ears. this is not the case; they are merely feather tufts. the ears are on the sides of the head in the usual location (in two different locations as described above). while the auditory and visual capabilities of the owl allow it to locate and pursue its prey, the talons and beak of the owl do the final work. the owl kills its prey using these talons to crush the skull and knead the body.[23] the crushing power of an owl's talons varies according to prey size and type, and by the size of the owl. the burrowing owl (athene cunicularia), a small, partly insectivorous owl, has a release force of only 5 n. the larger barn owl (tyto alba) needs a force of 30 n to release its prey, and one of the largest owls, the great horned owl (bubo virginianus) needs a force over 130 n to release prey in its talons.[27] an owl's talons, like those of most birds of prey, can seem massive in comparison to the body size outside of flight. the tasmanian masked owl has some of the proportionally longest talons of any bird of prey; they appear enormous in comparison to the body when fully extended to grasp prey.[28] an owl's claws are sharp and curved. the family tytonidae has inner and central toes of about equal length, while the family strigidae has an inner toe that is distinctly shorter than the central one.[27] these different morphologies allow efficiency in capturing prey specific to the different environments they inhabit. the beak of the owl is short, curved, and downward-facing, and typically hooked at the tip for gripping and tearing its prey. once prey is captured, the scissor motion of the top and lower bill is used to tear the tissue and kill. the sharp lower edge of the upper bill works in coordination with the sharp upper edge of the lower bill to deliver this motion. the downward-facing beak allows the owl's field of vision to be clear, as well as directing sound into the ears without deflecting sound waves away from the face.[citation needed] the coloration of the owl's plumage plays a key role in its ability to sit still and blend into the environment, making it nearly invisible to prey. owls tend to mimic the coloration and sometimes the texture patterns of their surroundings, the barn owl being an exception. the snowy owl (bubo scandiacus) appears nearly bleach-white in color with a few flecks of black, mimicking their snowy surroundings perfectly, while the speckled brown plumage of the tawny owl (strix aluco) allows it to lie in wait among the deciduous woodland it prefers for its habitat. likewise, the mottled wood-owl (strix ocellata) displays shades of brown, tan and black, making the owl nearly invisible in the surrounding trees, especially from behind. usually, the only tell-tale sign of a perched owl is its vocalizations or its vividly colored eyes. most owls are nocturnal, actively hunting their prey in darkness. several types of owls, however, are crepuscular—active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk; one example is the pygmy owl (glaucidium). a few owls are active during the day, also; examples are the burrowing owl (speotyto cunicularia) and the short-eared owl (asio flammeus). much of the owls' hunting strategy depends on stealth and surprise. owls have at least two adaptations that aid them in achieving stealth. first, the dull coloration of their feathers can render them almost invisible under certain conditions. secondly, serrated edges on the leading edge of owls' remiges muffle an owl's wing beats, allowing an owl's flight to be practically silent. some fish-eating owls, for which silence has no evolutionary advantage, lack this adaptation. an owl's sharp beak and powerful talons allow it to kill its prey before swallowing it whole (if it is not too big). scientists studying the diets of owls are helped by their habit of regurgitating the indigestible parts of their prey (such as bones, scales, and fur) in the form of pellets. these ""owl pellets"" are plentiful and easy to interpret, and are often sold by companies to schools for dissection by students as a lesson in biology and ecology.[29] owl eggs typically have a white colour and an almost spherical shape, and range in number from a few to a dozen, depending on species and the particular season; for most, three or four is the more common number. in at least one species, female owls do not mate with the same male for a lifetime. female burrowing owls commonly travel and find other mates, while the male stays in his territory and mates with other females.[30] the systematic placement of owls is disputed. for example, the sibley–ahlquist taxonomy of birds finds that, based on dna-dna hybridization, owls are more closely related to the nightjars and their allies (caprimulgiformes) than to the diurnal predators in the order falconiformes; consequently, the caprimulgiformes are placed in the strigiformes, and the owls in general become a family, the strigidae. a recent study indicates that the drastic rearrangement of the genome of the accipitrids may have obscured any close relationship of theirs with groups such as the owls.[31] in any case, the relationships of the caprimulgiformes, the owls, the falcons, and the accipitrid raptors are not resolved to satisfaction; currently, a trend to consider each group (with the possible exception of the accipitrids) as a distinct order is increasing. some 220 to 225 extant species of owls are known, subdivided into two families: 1. true owls or typical owls family (strigidae) and 2. barn-owls family (tytonidae). some entirely extinct families have also been erected based on fossil remains; these differ much from modern owls in being less specialized or specialized in a very different way (such as the terrestrial sophiornithidae). the paleocene genera berruornis and ogygoptynx show that owls were already present as a distinct lineage some 60–57 million years ago (mya), hence, possibly also some 5 million years earlier, at the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. this makes them one of the oldest known groups of non-galloanserae landbirds. the supposed ""cretaceous owls"" bradycneme and heptasteornis are apparently non-avialan maniraptors.[32] during the paleogene, the strigiformes radiated into ecological niches now mostly filled by other groups of birds.[clarification needed] the owls as known today, though, evolved their characteristic morphology and adaptations during that time, too. by the early neogene, the other lineages had been displaced by other bird orders, leaving only barn-owls and typical owls. the latter at that time were usually a fairly generic type of (probably earless) owls similar to today's north american spotted owl or the european tawny owl; the diversity in size and ecology found in typical owls today developed only subsequently. around the paleogene-neogene boundary (some 25 mya), barn-owls were the dominant group of owls in southern europe and adjacent asia at least; the distribution of fossil and present-day owl lineages indicates that their decline is contemporary with the evolution of the different major lineages of true owls, which for the most part seems to have taken place in eurasia. in the americas, rather, an expansion of immigrant lineages of ancestral typical owls occurred. the supposed fossil herons ""ardea"" perplexa (middle miocene of sansan, france) and ""ardea"" lignitum (late pliocene of germany) were more probably owls; the latter was apparently close to the modern genus bubo. judging from this, the late miocene remains from france described as ""ardea"" aureliensis should also be restudied.[33] the messelasturidae, some of which were initially believed to be basal strigiformes, are now generally accepted to be diurnal birds of prey showing some convergent evolution towards owls. the taxa often united under strigogyps[34] were formerly placed in part with the owls, specifically the sophiornithidae; they appear to be ameghinornithidae instead.[35][36][37] for fossil species and paleosubspecies of extant taxa, see the genus and species articles. for a full list of extant and recently extinct owls, see the article list of owl species. unresolved and basal forms (all fossil) fossil genera placement unresolved extinct genera fossil genera placement unresolved among the kikuyu of kenya, it was believed that owls were harbingers of death. if one saw an owl or heard its hoot, someone was going to die. in general, owls are viewed as harbingers of bad luck, ill health, or death. the belief is widespread even today.[40] in mongolia, the owl is regarded as a benign omen. in one story, genghis khan was hiding from enemies in a small coppice when an owl roosted in the tree above him, which caused his pursuers to think no man could be hidden there.[41] in modern japan, owls are regarded as lucky and are carried in the form of a talisman or charm.[42] the modern west generally associates owls with wisdom and vigilance. this link goes back at least as far as ancient greece, where athens, noted for art and scholarship, and athena, athens' patron goddess and the goddess of wisdom, had the owl as a symbol.[43] marija gimbutas traces veneration of the owl as a goddess, among other birds, to the culture of old europe, long pre-dating indo-european cultures.[44] t. f. thiselton-dyer, in his 1883 folk-lore of shakespeare, says that ""from the earliest period it has been considered a bird of ill-omen,"" and pliny tells us how, on one occasion, even rome itself underwent a lustration, because one of them strayed into the capitol. he represents it also as a funereal bird, a monster of the night, the very abomination of human kind. virgil describes its death-howl from the top of the temple by night, a circumstance introduced as a precursor of dido's death. ovid, too, constantly speaks of this bird's presence as an evil omen; and indeed the same notions respecting it may be found among the writings of most of the ancient poets.""[45] a list of ""omens drear"" in john keats' hyperion includes the ""gloom-bird's hated screech.""[46] pliny the elder reports that owl's eggs were commonly used as a hangover cure.[47] in hinduism, an owl is the vahana (mount) of the goddess lakshmi.[48] people often allude to the reputation of owls as bearers of supernatural danger when they tell misbehaving children, ""the owls will get you"",[49] and in most native american folklore, owls are a symbol of death. for example: encouraging natural predators to control rodent population is a natural form of pest control, along with excluding food sources for rodents. placing a nest box for owls on a property can help control rodent populations (one family of hungry barn owls can consume more than 3,000 rodents in a nesting season) while maintaining the naturally balanced food chain.[61] although humans and owls frequently live together in harmony, there have been incidents when owls have attacked humans. for example, in january 2013, a man from inverness, scotland suffered heavy bleeding and went into shock after being attacked by an owl, which was likely a 50-centimetre-tall (20 in) eagle-owl.[62] the photographer eric hosking lost his left eye after attempting to photograph a tawny owl, which inspired the title of his 1970 autobiography, an eye for a bird. all owls are listed in appendix ii of the international cites treaty (the convention on illegal trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora). although owls have long been hunted, a 2008 news story from malaysia indicates that the magnitude of owl poaching may be on the rise. in november 2008, traffic reported the seizure of 900 plucked and ""oven-ready"" owls in peninsular malaysia. said chris shepherd, senior programme officer for traffic's southeast asia office, ""this is the first time we know of where 'ready-prepared' owls have been seized in malaysia, and it may mark the start of a new trend in wild meat from the region. we will be monitoring developments closely."" traffic commended the department of wildlife and national parks in malaysia for the raid that exposed the huge haul of owls. included in the seizure were dead and plucked barn owls, spotted wood owls, crested serpent eagles, barred eagles, and brown wood owls, as well as 7,000 live lizards.[65] eurasia: north america: oceania: "
lion," the lion (panthera leo) is a species in the family felidae and a member of the genus panthera. it has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. it is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. with a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). it is a social species, forming groups called prides. a lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. the lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not. typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. it is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. in the pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout eurasia, africa and north america, but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-saharan africa and one critically endangered population in western india. it has been listed as vulnerable on the iucn red list since 1996 because populations in african countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the roman empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. cultural depictions of lions were prominent in the upper paleolithic period; carvings and paintings from the lascaux and chauvet caves in france have been dated to 17,000 years ago, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided with the lion's former and current ranges. the word 'lion' is derived from latin: leo[4] and ancient greek: λέων (leon).[5] the word lavi (hebrew: לָבִיא‎) may also be related.[6] the generic name panthera is traceable to the classical latin word 'panthēra' and the ancient greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.[7] panthera is phonetically similar to the sanskrit word पाण्डर pând-ara meaning 'pale yellow, whitish, white'.[8] felis leo was the scientific name used by carl linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work systema naturae.[3] the genus name panthera was coined by german naturalist lorenz oken in 1816.[13] between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005.[1] they were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and of their skins.[14] in the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, with about a dozen recognised as valid taxa until 2017.[1] between 2008 and 2016, iucn red list assessors used only two subspecific names: p. l. leo for african lion populations and p. l. persica for the asiatic lion population.[2][15][16] in 2017, the cat classification task force of the cat specialist group revised lion taxonomy, and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic studies on lion evolution, namely:[17] lion samples from some parts of the ethiopian highlands cluster genetically with those from cameroon and chad, while lions from other areas of ethiopia cluster with samples from east africa. researchers therefore assume ethiopia is a contact zone between the two subspecies.[20] genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion sample from sudan showed that it clustered with p. l. leo in mtdna-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to p. l. melanochaita. this result suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in central africa may require revision.[21] other lion subspecies or sister species to the modern lion existed in prehistoric times:[22] phylogenetic analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial dna from all felidae species indicate that their evolutionary radiation began in asia in the miocene around 14.45 to 8.38 million years ago to 16.76 to 6.46 million years ago. the panthera lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the felidae around 9.32 to 4.47 million years ago to 11.75 to 0.97 million years ago.[9][35][36] the geographic origin of the panthera is most likely northern central asia.[37] results of analyses differ in the phylogenetic relationship of the lion; it was thought to form a sister group with the jaguar (p. onca) that diverged 3.46 to 1.22 million years ago,[9] but also with the leopard (p. pardus) that diverged 3.1 to 1.95 million years ago[11][12] to 4.32 to 0.02 million years ago. hybridisation between lion and snow leopard (p. uncia) ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years ago.[36] the lion-leopard clade was distributed in the asian and african palearctic since at least the early pliocene.[37] the earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at olduvai gorge in tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million years old.[35] estimates for the divergence time of the modern and cave lion lineages range from 529,000 to 392,000 years ago based on mutation rate per generation time of the modern lion. there is no evidence for gene flow between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area.[21] the eurasian and american cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial period without mitochondrial descendants on other continents.[29][38][39] the modern lion was probably widely distributed in africa during the middle pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-saharan africa during the late pleistocene. lion populations in east and southern africa became separated from populations in west and north africa when the equatorial rainforest expanded 183,500 to 81,800 years ago.[40] they shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago.[21] due to the expansion of the sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion populations in west and north africa became separated. as the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more open habitats, lions moved from west to central africa. lions from north africa dispersed to southern europe and asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago.[40] extinction of lions in southern europe, north africa and the middle east interrupted gene flow between lion populations in asia and africa. genetic evidence revealed numerous mutations in lion samples from east and southern africa, which indicates that this group has a longer evolutionary history than genetically less diverse lion samples from asia and west and central africa.[41] a whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples showed that samples from west africa shared alleles with samples from southern africa, and samples from central africa shared alleles with samples from asia. this phenomenon indicates that central africa was a melting pot of lion populations after they had become isolated, possibly migrating through corridors in the nile basin during the early holocene.[21] in zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose.[42][43] the liger is bigger than a lion and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects.[44][45] the leopon is a hybrid between a lion and leopard.[46] the lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. the colours of the underparts are generally lighter. a new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. the lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual dimorphism. males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. the mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.[47][48] the tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that in some lions conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard ""spine"" or ""spur"" that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail bone. the functions of the spur are unknown. the tuft is absent at birth and develops at around ​5.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px;white-space:nowrap} 1⁄2 months of age. it is readily identifiable by the age of seven months.[49] of the living felid species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight, and height at the shoulder.[50] its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.[51][52] the size and weight of adult lions varies across global range and habitats.[53][54][55][56] accounts of a few individuals that were larger than average exist from africa and india.[47][57][58][59] the male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species.[14] it may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago.[61] it starts growing when lions are about a year old. mane colour varies and darkens with age; research shows its colour and size are influenced by environmental factors such as average ambient temperature. mane length apparently signals fighting success in male–male relationships; darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year. the presence, absence, colour and size of the mane are associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate and testosterone production; the rule of thumb is that a darker, fuller mane indicates a healthier animal. in serengeti national park, female lions favour males with dense, dark manes as mates. male lions usually aim for the backs or hindquarters of rivals, rather than their necks.[62][63] cool ambient temperature in european and north american zoos may result in a heavier mane.[64] asiatic lions usually have sparser manes than average african lions.[65] almost all male lions in pendjari national park are either maneless or have very short manes.[66] maneless lions have also been reported in senegal, in sudan's dinder national park and in tsavo east national park, kenya.[67] the original male white lion from timbavati in south africa was also maneless. the hormone testosterone has been linked to mane growth; castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production.[68] increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern botswana.[69] the white lion is a rare morph with a genetic condition called leucism which is caused by a double recessive allele. it is not albino; it has normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. white lions have occasionally been encountered in and around kruger national park and the adjacent timbavati private game reserve in eastern south africa. they were removed from the wild in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion gene pool. nevertheless, 17 births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015.[70] white lions are selected for breeding in captivity.[71] they have reportedly been bred in camps in south africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.[72] african lions live in scattered populations across sub-saharan africa. the lion prefers grassy plains and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers and open woodlands with bushes. it is absent from rainforest and rarely enters closed forest. on mount elgon, the lion has been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to the snow line on mount kenya.[47] lions occur in savannah grasslands with scattered acacia trees, which serve as shade.[73] the asiatic lion now survives only in and around gir national park in gujarat, western india. its habitat is a mixture of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous scrub forest.[15] in africa, the range of the lion originally spanned most of the central rainforest zone and the sahara desert.[74] in the 1960s, it became extinct in north africa, except in the southern part of sudan.[75][76][77] in southern europe and asia, the lion once ranged in regions where climatic conditions supported an abundance of prey.[78] in greece, it was common as reported by herodotus in 480 bc; it was considered rare by 300 bc and extirpated by ad 100.[47] it was present in the caucasus until the 10th century.[52] it lived in palestine until the middle ages, and in southwest asia until the late 19th century. by the late 19th century, it had been extirpated in most of turkey.[79] the last live lion in iran was sighted in 1942 about 65 km (40 mi) northwest of dezful,[80] although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the karun river in khūzestān province in 1944.[81] it once ranged from sind and punjab in pakistan to bengal and the narmada river in central india.[82] lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day.[83] although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating. intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. they spend an average of two hours a day walking and fifty minutes eating.[84] the lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of related individuals with their offspring. such a group is called a ""pride"". groups of male lions are called ""coalitions"".[85] females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females.[86] membership changes only with the births and deaths of lionesses,[87] although some females leave and become nomadic.[88] the average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed.[89] the sole exception to this pattern is the tsavo lion pride that always has just one adult male.[90] male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around two or three years of age.[88] some lions are ""nomads"" that range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or alone.[85] pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads can become residents and vice versa.[91] interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrus allow nomadic males to approach them.[92] males spend years in a nomadic phase before gaining residence in a pride.[93] a study undertaken in the serengeti national park revealed that nomadic coalitions gain residency at between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age.[94] in kruger national park, dispersing male lions move more than 25 km (16 mi) away from their natal pride in search of their own territory. female lions stay closer to their natal pride. therefore, female lions in an area are more closely related to each other than male lions in the same area.[95] the area occupied by a pride is called a ""pride area"" whereas that occupied by a nomad is a ""range"".[85] males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their territory. the reasons for the development of sociality in lionesses—the most pronounced in any cat species—are the subject of much debate. increased hunting success appears to be an obvious reason, but this is uncertain upon examination; coordinated hunting allows for more successful predation but also ensures non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake. some females, however, take a role raising cubs that may be left alone for extended periods. members of the pride tend to regularly play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. the health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride; hunters are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. other benefits include possible kin selection; sharing food within the family; protecting the young, maintaining territory and individual insurance against injury and hunger.[57] both males and females defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build. some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind.[96] lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride; slower-moving individuals may provide other valuable services to the group.[97] alternatively, there may be rewards associated with being a leader that fends off intruders; the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses.[98] the male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship with the pride from outside males who may attempt to usurp them.[91] asiatic lion prides differ in group composition. male asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to three males, forming a loose pride while females associate with up to 12 other females, forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. female and male lions associate only when mating.[99] coalitions of males hold territory for a longer time than single lions. males in coalitions of three or four individuals exhibit a pronounced hierarchy, in which one male dominates the others and mates more frequently.[100] the lion is a generalist hypercarnivore[101] and is considered to be both an apex and keystone predator due to its wide prey spectrum.[102] its prey consists mainly of mammals—particularly ungulates—weighing 190–550 kg (420–1,210 lb) with a preference for blue wildebeest, plains zebra, african buffalo, gemsbok and giraffe. lions also hunt common warthog depending on availability, although the species is below the preferred weight range.[103] in india, sambar deer and chital are the most commonly recorded wild prey,[48][103][104] while domestic livestock may contribute significantly to their diet.[104] they usually avoid fully grown adult elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamus, as well as small prey like dik-dik, hyrax, hare and monkey.[103][105] unusual prey items include porcupines, small reptiles, cape fur seals and cormorants.[106] lions kill other predators such as leopard, cheetah and spotted hyena but seldom consume them.[107] young lions first display stalking behaviour at around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old and begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two.[108] single lions are capable of bringing down zebra and wildebeest, while larger prey like buffalo and giraffe are riskier.[91] in chobe national park, large prides have been observed hunting african bush elephants up to around 15 years old in exceptional cases, with most of the victims being juveniles or subadults.[109][110] in typical hunts, each lioness has a favoured position in the group, either stalking prey on the ""wing"", then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey fleeing from other lionesses. males attached to prides do not usually participate in group hunting.[111] some evidence suggests, however, that males are just as successful as females; they are typically solo hunters who ambush prey in small bushland.[112] lions are not particularly known for their stamina; for instance, a lioness' heart comprises only 0.57% of her body weight and a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight, whereas a hyena's heart comprises almost 1% of its body weight.[113] thus, lions run quickly only in short bursts[114] and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. they take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.[115] the lion's attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch prey with a fast rush and final leap. they usually pull it down by the rump and kill by a strangling bite to the throat. they also kill prey by enclosing its mouth and nostrils in their jaws.[116] lions typically consume prey at the location of the hunt but sometimes drag large prey into cover.[117] they tend to squabble over kills, particularly the males. cubs suffer most when food is scarce but otherwise all pride members eat their fill, including old and crippled lions, which can live on leftovers.[91] large kills are shared more widely among pride members.[118] an adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg (11 lb) of meat per day while males require about 7 kg (15 lb).[119] lions gorge themselves and eat up to 30 kg (66 lb) in one session;[81] if it is unable to consume all of the kill, it rests for a few hours before continuing to eat. on hot days, the pride retreats to shade with one or two males standing guard.[117] lions defend their kills from scavengers such as vultures and hyenas.[91] lions scavenge on carrion when the opportunity arises; they scavenge animals dead from natural causes such as disease or those that were killed by other predators. scavenging lions keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, which indicate the death or distress of an animal.[120] most carrion on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by hyenas rather than lions.[56] carrion is thought to provide a large part of lion diet.[121] lions and spotted hyenas occupy a similar ecological niche and where they coexist they compete for prey and carrion; a review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%.[122] lions typically ignore spotted hyenas unless the lions are on a kill or are being harassed by the hyenas, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions, with or without the presence of food. lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas; in the ngorongoro crater it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate.[123] in botswana's chobe national park, the situation is reversed; hyenas frequently challenge lions and steal their kills, obtaining food from 63% of all lion kills.[124] when confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 m (100–330 ft) until the lions have finished.[125] hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions and to force the lions off a kill. the two species attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason.[126][127] lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in etosha national park. spotted hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their territories.[128] when the lion population in kenya's masai mara national reserve declined, the spotted hyena population increased rapidly.[129] experiments on captive spotted hyenas show that specimens without prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to lion scent.[123] lions tend to dominate cheetahs and leopards, steal their kills and kill their cubs and even adults when given the chance.[130] cheetahs in particular often lose their kills to lions or other predators.[131] a study in the serengeti ecosystem revealed that lions killed at least 17 of 125 cheetah cubs born between 1987 and 1990.[132] cheetahs avoid their competitors by using different temporal and habitat niches.[133] leopards are able to take refuge in trees; lionesses, however, occasionally attempt to retrieve leopard kills from trees.[134] lions similarly dominate african wild dogs, taking their kills and preying on young and rarely adult dogs. population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant.[135] however, there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs.[136][137] lions also charge at nile crocodiles; depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion, either animal can lose their kills to the other. lions have been observed killing crocodiles that ventured onto land.[138] crocodiles may also kill and eat lions, evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.[139] most lionesses reproduce by the time they are four years of age.[140] lions do not mate at a specific time of year and the females are polyestrous.[141] like those of other cats, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. during withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation.[142][143] a lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.[144] generation length of the lion is about seven years.[145] the average gestation period is around 110 days;[141] the female gives birth to a litter of between one and four cubs in a secluded den, which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area, usually away from the pride. she will often hunt alone while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the den.[146] lion cubs are born blind; their eyes open around seven days after birth. they weigh 1.2–2.1 kg (2.6–4.6 lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.[147] to avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-one by the nape of the neck.[146] usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old.[146] sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time.[91][148] when first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. they soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults.[148] lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. male tolerance of the cubs varies—one male could patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, while another may snarl and bat the cubs away.[149] pride lionesses often synchronise their reproductive cycles and communal rearing and suckling of the young, which suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. the synchronisation of births is advantageous because the cubs grow to being roughly the same size and have an equal chance of survival, and sucklings are not dominated by older cubs.[91][148] weaning occurs after six or seven months. male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. they begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.[150] when one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male.[151] cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs.[137][91] up to 80% of lion cubs will die before the age of two.[152] both male and female lions may be ousted from prides to become nomads, although most females usually remain with their birth pride. when a pride becomes too large, however, the youngest generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to find their own territory. when a new male lion takes over a pride, adolescents both male and female may be evicted.[153] lions of both sexes may be involved in group homosexual and courtship activities; males will also head-rub and roll around with each other before simulating sex together.[154][155] although adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests most die violently from attacks by humans or other lions.[156] lions often inflict serious injuries on members of other prides they encounter in territorial disputes or members of the home pride when fighting at a kill.[157] crippled lions and cubs may fall victim to hyenas and leopards or be trampled by buffalo or elephants. careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.[158] ticks commonly infest the ears, neck and groin regions of lions.[159][160] adult forms of several species of the tapeworm genus taenia have been isolated from lion intestines, having been ingested as larvae in antelope meat.[161] lions in the ngorongoro crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (stomoxys calcitrans) in 1962; this resulted in lions becoming emaciated and covered in bloody, bare patches. lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many died or migrated and the local population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals.[162] a more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions.[163] captive lions have been infected with canine distemper virus (cdv) since at least the mid 1970s.[164] cdv is spread by domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in serengeti national park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. during the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis.[165] feline immunodeficiency virus and lentivirus also affect captive lions.[166][167] when resting, lion socialisation occurs through a number of behaviours; the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. the most common peaceful, tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking,[168] which have been compared with the role of allogrooming among primates.[169] head rubbing—nuzzling the forehead, face and neck against another lion—appears to be a form of greeting[170] and is seen often after an animal has been apart from others or after a fight or confrontation. males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females.[171] social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. the head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked; this behaviour may have arisen out of utility because lions cannot lick these areas themselves.[172] lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.[173] a common facial expression is the ""grimace face"" or flehmen response, which a lion makes when sniffing chemical signals and involves an open mouth with bared teeth, raised muzzle, wrinkled nose closed eyes and relaxed ears.[174] lions also use chemical and visual marking; males will spray and scrape plots of ground and objects within the territory.[173] the lion's repertoire of vocalisations is large; variations in intensity and pitch appear to be central to communication. most lion vocalisations are variations of growling, snarling, meowing and roaring. other sounds produced include purring, puffing, bleating and humming. roaring is used to advertise its presence. lions most often roar at night, a sound that can be heard from a distance of 8 kilometres (5.0 mi).[175] they tend to roar in a very characteristic manner starting with a few deep, long roars that subside into a series of shorter ones.[176][177] the lion is listed as vulnerable on the iucn red list.[2] several large and well-managed protected areas in africa host large lion populations. where an infrastructure for wildlife tourism has been developed, cash revenue for park management and local communities is a strong incentive for lion conservation.[2] most lions now live in east and southern africa; their numbers are rapidly decreasing, and fell by an estimated 30–50% in the late half of the 20th century. primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference.[2] in 1975, it was estimated that since the 1950s, lion numbers had decreased by half to 200,000 or fewer.[178] estimates of the african lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004.[179][75] in the republic of the congo, odzala-kokoua national park was considered a lion stronghold in the 1990s. by 2014, no lions were recorded in the protected area so the population is considered locally extinct.[180] the west african lion population is isolated from the one in central africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. in 2015, it was estimated that this population consists of about 400 animals, including fewer than 250 mature individuals. they persist in three protected areas in the region, mostly in one population in the w a p protected area complex, shared by benin, burkina faso and niger. this population is listed as critically endangered.[16] field surveys in the wap ecosystem revealed that lion occupancy is lowest in the w national park, and higher in areas with permanent staff and thus better protection.[181] a population occurs in cameroon's waza national park, where between approximately 14 and 21 animals persisted as of 2009.[182] in addition, 50 to 150 lions are estimated to be present in burkina faso's arly-singou ecosystem.[183] in 2015, an adult male lion and a female lion were sighted in ghana's mole national park. these were the first sightings of lions in the country in 39 years.[184] in the same year, a population of up to 200 lions that was previously thought to have been extirpated was filmed in the alatash national park, ethiopia, close to the sudanese border.[185][186] in 2005, lion conservation strategies were developed for west and central africa, and or east and southern africa. the strategies seek to maintain suitable habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base for lions, reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations, and make lion–human coexistence sustainable.[187][188] lion depredation on livestock is significantly reduced in areas where herders keep livestock in improved enclosures. such measures contribute to mitigating human–lion conflict.[189] the last refuge of the asiatic lion population is the 1,412 km2 (545 sq mi) gir national park and surrounding areas in the region of saurashtra or kathiawar peninsula in gujarat state, india. the population has risen from approximately 180 lions in 1974 to about 400 in 2010.[190] it is geographically isolated, which can lead to inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity. since 2008, the asiatic lion has been listed as endangered on the iucn red list.[15] by 2015, the population had grown to 523 individuals inhabiting an area of 7,000 km2 (2,700 sq mi) in saurashtra.[191][192][193] the asiatic lion census conducted in 2017 recorded about 650 individuals.[194] the presence of numerous human habitations close to the national park results in conflict between lions, local people and their livestock.[195][191] some consider the presence of lions a benefit, as they keep populations of crop damaging herbivores in check.[196] the establishment of a second, independent asiatic lion population in kuno wildlife sanctuary, located in madhya pradesh was planned but in 2017, the asiatic lion reintroduction project seemed unlikely to be implemented.[197][198] lions imported to europe before the middle of the 19th century were possibly foremost barbary lions from north africa, or cape lions from southern africa.[199] another 11 animals thought to be barbary lions kept in addis ababa zoo are descendants of animals owned by emperor haile selassie. wildlink international in collaboration with oxford university launched an ambitious international barbary lion project with the aim of identifying and breeding barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the atlas mountains of morocco.[200] however, a genetic analysis showed that the captive lions at addis ababa zoo were not barbary lions, but rather closely related to wild lions in chad and cameroon.[201] in 1982, the association of zoos and aquariums started a species survival plan for the asiatic lion to increase its chances of survival. in 1987, it was found that most lions in north american zoos were hybrids between african and asiatic lions.[202] breeding programs need to note origins of the participating animals to avoid cross-breeding different subspecies and thus reducing their conservation value.[203] captive breeding of lions was halted to eliminate individuals of unknown origin and pedigree. wild-born lions were imported to american zoos from africa between 1989 and 1995. breeding was continued in 1998 in the frame of an african lion species survival plan.[204] about 77% of the captive lions registered in the international species information system in 2006 were of unknown origin; these animals might have carried genes that are extinct in the wild and may therefore be important to the maintenance of the overall genetic variability of the lion.[64] lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century. although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits,[205] there are more than 1,000 african and 100 asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. they are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes.[206] lions can live over twenty years in captivity; a lion in honolulu zoo died at the age of 22 in august 2007.[207] his two sisters, born in 1986, also reached the age of 22.[208] the first european ""zoos"" spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century, and until the 17th century were called seraglios; at that time they came to be called menageries, an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. they spread from france and italy during the renaissance to the rest of europe.[209] in england, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, lions were kept at the tower of london in a seraglio established by king john in the 13th century;[210][211] this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by henry i at his hunting lodge in woodstock, oxfordshire, where according to william of malmesbury lions had been stocked.[212] lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at london zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s.[213] further changes took place in the early 20th century when carl hagenbeck designed enclosures with concrete ""rocks"", more open space and a moat instead of bars, more closely resembling a natural habitat. hagenbeck designed lion enclosures for both melbourne zoo and sydney's taronga zoo; although his designs were popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the 1960s.[214] in the late 20th century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals; some attractions such as the cat forest/lion overlook of oklahoma city zoological park placed the den on ground level, higher than visitors.[215] lion taming has been part of both established circuses and individual acts such as siegfried & roy. the practice began in the early 19th century by frenchman henri martin and american isaac van amburgh, who both toured widely and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.[216] van amburgh performed before queen victoria in 1838 when he toured great britain. martin composed a pantomime titled les lions de mysore (""the lions of mysore""), an idea amburgh quickly borrowed. these acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows and entered public consciousness in the early 20th century with cinema. in demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.[216] the ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by the placing of the tamer's head in the lion's mouth. the now-iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by american clyde beatty (1903–1965).[217] lion hunting has occurred since ancient times and was often a royal pastime; intended to demonstrate the power of the king over nature. the earliest surviving record of lion hunting is an ancient egyptian inscription dated circa 1380 bc that mentions pharaoh amenhotep iii killing 102 lions ""with his own arrows"" during the first ten years of his rule. the assyrians would release captive lions in a reserved space for the king to hunt; this event would be watched by spectators as the king and his men, on horseback or chariots, killed the lions with arrows and spears. lions were also hunted during the mughal empire, where emperor jahangir is said to have excelled at it.[218] in ancient rome, lions were kept by emperors for hunts as well as gladiator fights and executions.[219] the maasai people have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of passage. historically, lions were hunted by individuals, however, due to reduced lion populations, elders discourage solo lion hunts.[220] during the european colonisation of africa in the 19th century, the hunting of lions was encouraged because they were considered as vermin and lion hides fetched £1 each.[221] the widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century.[222] trophy hunting of lions in recent years has been met with controversy; notably with the killing of cecil the lion in mid-2015.[223] lions do not usually hunt humans but some (usually males) seem to seek them out. one well-publicised case is the tsavo maneaters; in 1898, 28 officially recorded railway workers building the kenya-uganda railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge in kenya.[224] the hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour; they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. the infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.[225] sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but the behaviour is not unusual, nor necessarily aberrant.[226] lions' proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. american and tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. at least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period. the incidents occurred near selous national park in rufiji district and in lindi province near the mozambican border. while the expansion of villages into bush country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. cases in lindi in which lions seize humans from the centres of substantial villages have been documented.[227] another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon, when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.[228] according to robert r. frump, mozambican refugees regularly crossing kruger national park, south africa, at night are attacked and eaten by lions; park officials have said man-eating is a problem there. frump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night. for nearly a century before the border was sealed, mozambicans had regularly crossed the park in daytime with little harm.[229] the lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. it has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature.[47] it appeared as a symbol for strength and nobility in cultures across europe, asia and africa, despite incidents of attacks on people. the lion has been depicted as ""king of the jungle"" and ""king of beasts"", and thus became a popular symbol for royalty and stateliness.[231] the lion is also used as a symbol of sporting teams.[232][233][234] depictions of lions are known from the upper paleolithic period. carvings and paintings of lions discovered in the lascaux and chauvet caves in france have been dated to 15,000 to 17,000 years old.[235][230] a lioness-headed ivory carving found in vogelherd cave in the swabian alb, southwest germany, is dubbed löwenmensch (lion-human) in german. the sculpture has been dated to least 32,000 years old—and as early as 40,000 years ago[236]—and originated from the aurignacian culture.[29] in sub-saharan africa, the lion has been a common character in stories, proverbs and dances, but rarely featured in visual arts.[237] in some cultures, the lion symbolises power and royalty.[238] in swahili language, the lion is known as simba which also means ""aggressive"", ""king"" and ""strong"".[55] some rulers had the word ""lion"" in their nickname. sundiata keita of the mali empire was called ""lion of mali"".[239] the founder of the waalo kingdom is said to have been raised by lions and returned to his people part-lion to unite them using the knowledge he learned from the lions.[238] in parts of west africa, lions symbolised the top class of their social hierarchies.[238] in more heavily forested areas where lions were rare, the leopard represented the top of the hierarchy.[237] in parts of west and east africa, the lion is associated with healing and is regarded as the link between seers and the supernatural. in other east african traditions, the lion is the symbol of laziness.[238] in much of african folklore, the lion is portrayed as having low intelligence and is easily tricked by other animals.[239] the ancient egyptians portrayed several of their war deities as lionesses, which they revered as fierce hunters. egyptian deities associated with lions include sekhmet, bast, mafdet, menhit, pakhet and tefnut.[231] these deities were often connected with the sun god ra and his fierce heat, and their dangerous power was invoked to guard people or sacred places. the sphinx, a figure with a lion's body and the head of a human or other creature, represented a pharaoh or deity who had taken on this protective role.[240] the lion was a prominent symbol in ancient mesopotamia from sumer up to assyrian and babylonian times, where it was strongly associated with kingship.[241] lions were among the major symbols of the goddess inanna/ishtar.[242][243] the lion of babylon was the foremost symbol of the babylonian empire.[244] the lion hunt of ashurbanipal is a famous sequence of assyrian palace reliefs from c. 640 bc, now in the british museum.[245] the lion of judah is the biblical emblem of the tribe of judah and the later kingdom of judah.[246] lions are frequently mentioned in the bible; notably in the book of daniel in which the eponymous hero refuses to worship king darius and is forced to sleep in the lions' den where he is miraculously unharmed (dan 6). in the book of judges, samson kills a lion as he travels to visit a philistine woman.(judg 14).[247] indo-persian chroniclers regarded the lion as keeper of order in the realm of animals. the sanskrit word mrigendra signifies a lion as king of animals in general or deer in particular.[248] narasimha, the man-lion, is one of ten avatars of the hindu god vishnu.[249] singh is an ancient indian vedic name meaning ""lion"", dating back over 2,000 years. it was originally used only by rajputs, a hindu kshatriya or military caste but is used by millions of hindu rajputs and more than twenty million sikhs today.[250] the lion capital of ashoka, erected by emperor ashoka in the 3rd century ce, depicts four lions standing back to back. it was made the national emblem of india in 1950.[251] the lion is also symbolic for the sinhalese people;[252] the term derived from the sanskrit sinhala, meaning ""of lions""[253] while a sword-wielding lion is the central figure on the national flag of sri lanka.[254] the lion is a common motif in chinese art; it was first used in art during the late spring and autumn period (fifth or sixth century bc) and became more popular during the han dynasty (206 bc – ad 220) when imperial guardian lions started to be placed in front of imperial palaces for protection. because lions have never been native to china, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of buddhist art to china in the tang dynasty after the sixth century ad, lions were usually depicted wingless with shorter, thicker bodies and curly manes.[255] the lion dance is a traditional dance in chinese culture in which performers in lion costumes mimic a lion's movements, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums and gongs. they are performed at chinese new year, the august moon festival and other celebratory occasions for good luck.[256] lion-headed figures and amulets were excavated in tombs in the greek islands of crete, euboea, rhodes, paros and chios. they are associated with the egyptian deity sekhmet and date to the early iron age between the 9th and 6th centuries bc.[257] the lion is featured in several of aesop's fables, notably the lion and the mouse.[258] the nemean lion was symbolic in ancient greece and rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign leo, and described in mythology, where it was killed and worn by the hero heracles,[259] symbolising victory over death.[260] lancelot and gawain were also heroes slaying lions in the middle ages. in some medieval stories, lions were portrayed as allies and companions.[261] ""lion"" was the nickname of several medieval warrior-rulers with a reputation for bravery, such as richard the lionheart.[231] lions continue to appear in modern literature as characters including the messianic aslan in the 1950 novel the lion, the witch and the wardrobe and the chronicles of narnia series by c. s. lewis,[262] and the comedic cowardly lion in l. frank baum's 1900 the wonderful wizard of oz.[263] lion symbolism was used from the advent of cinema; one of the most iconic and widely recognised lions is leo, which has been the mascot for metro-goldwyn-mayer studios since the 1920s.[264] the 1966 film born free features elsa the lioness and is based on the 1960 non-fiction book with the same title.[265] the lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in the 1994 disney animated feature film the lion king.[266] lions are frequently depicted on coats of arms, like on the coat of arms of finland,[267] either as a device on shields or as supporters, but the lioness is used much less frequently.[268] the heraldic lion is particularly common in british arms. it is traditionally depicted in a great variety of attitudes, although within french heraldry only lions rampant are considered to be lions; feline figures in any other position are instead referred to as leopards.[269] "
ox,"an ox (plural oxen), also known as a bullock in australia and india, is a bovine trained as a draft animal. oxen are commonly castrated adult male cattle; castration makes the animals easier to control. cows (adult females) or bulls (intact males) may also be used in some areas. oxen are used for plowing, for transport (pulling carts, hauling wagons and even riding), for threshing grain by trampling, and for powering machines that grind grain or supply irrigation among other purposes. oxen may be also used to skid logs in forests, particularly in low-impact, select-cut logging. oxen are usually yoked in pairs. light work such as carting household items on good roads might require just one pair, while for heavier work, further pairs would be added as necessary. a team used for a heavy load over difficult ground might exceed nine or ten pairs. oxen are thought to have first been harnessed and put to work around 4000 bc.[1] working oxen are taught to respond to the signals of the teamster, bullocky or ox-driver. these signals are given by verbal command and body language, reinforced by a goad, whip or a long pole (which also serves as a measure of length: see rod). in pre-industrial times, most teamsters were known for their loud voices and forthright language. verbal commands for draft animals vary widely throughout the world. in north america, the most common commands are: in the new england tradition, young castrated cattle selected for draft are known as working steers and are painstakingly trained from a young age. their teamster makes or buys as many as a dozen yokes of different sizes for each animal as it grows. the steers are normally considered fully trained at the age of four and only then become known as oxen.[2] a tradition in south eastern england was to use oxen (often sussex cattle) as dual-purpose animals: for draft and beef. a plowing team of eight oxen normally consisted of four pairs aged a year apart. each year, a pair of steers of about three years of age would be bought for the team and trained with the older animals. the pair would be kept for about four years, then sold at about seven years old to be fattened for beef – thus covering much of the cost of buying that year's new pair. use of oxen for plowing survived in some areas of england (such as the south downs) until the early twentieth century. pairs of oxen were always hitched the same way round, and they were often given paired names. in southern england it was traditional to call the near-side (left) ox of a pair by a single-syllable name and the off-side (right) one by a longer one (for example: lark and linnet, turk and tiger).[3] ox trainers favor larger animals for their ability to do more work. oxen are therefore usually of larger breeds, and are usually males because they are generally larger. females can also be trained as oxen, but as well as being smaller, are often more valued for producing calves and milk. bulls are also used in many parts of the world, especially asia and africa.[4][5] working oxen usually require shoes,[6] although in england not all working oxen were shod.[7] since their hooves are cloven, two shoes are required for each hoof, as opposed to a single horseshoe. ox shoes are usually of approximately half-moon or banana shape, either with or without caulkins, and are fitted in symmetrical pairs to the hooves. unlike horses, oxen are not easily able to balance on three legs while a farrier shoes the fourth.[6][8] in england, shoeing was accomplished by throwing the ox to the ground and lashing all four feet to a heavy wooden tripod until the shoeing was complete.[6] a similar technique was used in serbia[9] and, in a simpler form, in india,[10] where it is still practiced.[11] in italy, where oxen may be very large, shoeing is accomplished using a massive framework of beams in which the animal can be partly or completely lifted from the ground by slings passed under the body; the feet are then lashed to lateral beams or held with a rope while the shoes are fitted.[12][13] such devices were made of wood in the past, but may today be of metal. similar devices are found in france, austria, germany, spain, canada and the united states, where they may be called ox slings, ox presses or shoeing stalls.[8][14] the system was sometimes adopted in england also, where the device was called a crush or trevis; one example is recorded in the vale of pewsey.[7] the shoeing of an ox partly lifted in a sling is the subject of john singer sargent's painting shoeing the ox,[15] while a smith shoeing an ox by karel dujardin shows an ox being shod standing, tied to a post by the horns and balanced by supporting the raised hoof. a single left-hand ox shoe of the type used for large chianina oxen in tuscany karel dujardin, 1622–1678: a smith shoeing an ox ox shoeing sling in the dorfmuseum of mönchhof, austria; a pair of ox shoes is attached to the near left column. oxen can pull heavier loads, and pull for a longer period of time than horses depending on weather conditions.[16] on the other hand, they are also slower than horses, which has both advantages and disadvantages; their pulling style is steadier, but they cannot cover as much ground in a given period of time. for agricultural purposes, oxen are more suitable for heavy tasks such as breaking sod or plowing in wet, heavy, or clay-filled soil. when hauling freight, oxen can move very heavy loads in a slow and steady fashion. they are at a disadvantage compared to horses when it is necessary to pull a plow or load of freight relatively quickly. for millennia, oxen also could pull heavier loads because of the use of the yoke, which was designed to work best with the neck and shoulder anatomy of cattle. until the invention of the horse collar, which allowed the horse to engage the pushing power of its hindquarters in moving a load, horses could not pull with their full strength because the yoke was incompatible with their anatomy[17] (yokes press on their chest, inhibiting their breathing). well-trained oxen are also considered less excitable than horses. "
pig," a pig is any of the animals in the genus sus, within the even-toed ungulate family suidae. pigs include domestic pigs and their ancestor, the common eurasian wild boar (sus scrofa), along with other species. pigs, like all suids, are native to the eurasian and african continents, ranging from europe to the pacific islands. suids other than the pig are the babirusa of indonesia, the pygmy hog of south asia, the warthog of africa, and another genus of pigs from africa. the suids are a sister clade to peccaries. juvenile pigs are known as piglets.[1] pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.[2] with around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domestic pig is among the most populous large mammals in the world.[3][4] pigs are omnivores and can consume a wide range of food.[5] pigs are biologically similar to humans and are thus frequently used for human medical research.[6] the online etymology dictionary provides anecdotal evidence as well as linguistic, saying that the term derives probably from old english *picg, found in compounds, ultimate origin unknown. originally ""young pig"" (the word for adults was swine). apparently related to low german bigge, dutch big (""but the phonology is difficult"" -- oed). ... another old english word for ""pig"" was fearh, related to furh ""furrow,"" from pie *perk- ""dig, furrow"" (source also of latin porc-us ""pig,"" see pork). ""this reflects a widespread ie tendency to name animals from typical attributes or activities"" [roger lass]. synonyms grunter, oinker are from sailors' and fishermen's euphemistic avoidance of uttering the word pig at sea, a superstition perhaps based on the fate of the gadarene swine, who drowned.[7] the online etymology dictionary also traces the evolution of sow, the term for a female pig, through various historical languages: old english sugu, su ""female of the swine,"" from proto-germanic *su- (cognates: old saxon, old high german su, german sau, dutch zeug, old norse syr), from pie root *su- (cognates: sanskrit sukarah ""wild boar, swine;"" avestan hu ""wild boar;"" greek hys ""swine;"" latin sus ""swine"", suinus ""pertaining to swine""; old church slavonic svinija ""swine;"" lettish sivens ""young pig;"" welsh hucc, irish suig ""swine; old irish socc ""snout, plowshare""), possibly imitative of pig noise; note that sanskrit sukharah means ""maker of (the sound) su.[7] an adjectival form is porcine. another adjectival form (technically for the subfamily rather than genus name) is suine (comparable to bovine, canine, etc.); for the family, it is suid (as with bovid, canid). a typical pig has a large head with a long snout that is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and by a disk of cartilage at the tip.[8] the snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ. there are four hoofed toes on each foot, with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight, but the outer two also being used in soft ground.[9] the dental formula of adult pigs is 3.1.4.33.1.4.3, giving a total of 44 teeth. the rear teeth are adapted for crushing. in the male, the canine teeth form tusks, which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.[8] occasionally, captive mother pigs may savage their own piglets, often if they become severely stressed.[10] some attacks on newborn piglets are non-fatal. others may cause the death of the piglets and sometimes, the mother may eat the piglets. it is estimated that 50% of piglet fatalities are due to the mother attacking, or unintentionally crushing, the newborn pre-weaned animals.[11] with around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domestic pig is one of the most numerous large mammals on the planet.[3][4] the ancestor of the domestic pig is the wild boar, which is one of the most numerous and widespread large mammals. its many subspecies are native to all but the harshest climates of continental eurasia and its islands and africa as well, from ireland and india to japan and north to siberia. long isolated from other pigs on the many islands of indonesia, malaysia, and the philippines, pigs have evolved into many different species, including wild boar, bearded pigs, and warty pigs. humans have introduced pigs into australia, north and south america, and numerous islands, either accidentally as escaped domestic pigs which have gone feral, or as wild boar. the wild boar (sus scrofa) can take advantage of any forage resources. therefore, they can live in virtually any productive habitat that can provide enough water to sustain large mammals such as pigs. if there is increased foraging of wild boars in certain areas, they can cause a nutritional shortage which can cause the pig population to decrease. if the nutritional state returns to normal, the pig population will most likely rise due to the pigs' naturally increased reproduction rate.[12] pigs are omnivores, which means that they consume both plants and animals. in the wild, they are foraging animals, primarily eating leaves, roots, fruits, and flowers, in addition to some insects and fish. as livestock, pigs are fed mostly corn and soybean meal[13] with a mixture of vitamins and minerals added to the diet. traditionally, they were raised on dairy farms and called ""mortgage lifters"", due to their ability to use the excess milk as well as whey from cheese and butter making combined with pasture.[14] older pigs will consume three to five gallons of water per day.[15] when kept as pets, the optimal healthy diet consists mainly of a balanced diet of raw vegetables, although some may give their pigs conventional mini pig pellet feed.[16] domesticated pigs, especially miniature breeds, are commonly kept as pets.[17] domestic pigs are raised commercially as livestock; materials that are garnered include their meat (known as pork), leather, and their bristly hairs which are used to make brushes. because of their foraging abilities and excellent sense of smell, they are used to find truffles in many european countries. both wild and feral pigs are commonly hunted. the relatively short, stiff, coarse hairs of the pig are called bristles, and were once so commonly used in paintbrushes that in 1946 the australian government launched operation pig bristle. in may 1946, in response to a shortage of pig bristles for paintbrushes to paint houses in the post-world war ii construction boom, the royal australian air force (raaf) flew in 28 short tons of pig bristles from china, their only commercially available source at the time.[18] human skin is very similar to pig skin, therefore pig skin has been used in many preclinical studies.[19][20] in addition to providing use in biomedical research[19][20] and for drug testing,[21] genetic advances in human healthcare have provided a pathway for domestic pigs to become xenotransplantation candidates for humans.[22] the genus sus is currently thought to contain eight living species. a number of extinct species (†) are known from fossils. the pygmy hog, formerly sus salvanius is now placed in the monotypic genus porcula.[23] pigs have been domesticated since ancient times in the old world. archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern new guineans from wild boar as early as 13,000–12,700 bp in the near east in the tigris basin,[24] çayönü, cafer höyük, nevalı çori.[25] remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 bp in cyprus that must have been introduced from the mainland which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then.[26] a separate domestication also occurred in china.[27] in india, pigs have been domesticated for a long time mostly in goa and some rural areas for pig toilets. this was also done in china. though ecologically logical as well as economical, pig toilets are waning in popularity as use of septic tanks and/or sewerage systems is increasing in rural areas. pigs were brought to southeastern north america from europe by hernando de soto and other early spanish explorers. pigs are particularly valued in china and on certain oceanic islands, where their self-sufficiency allows them to be turned loose, although the practice is not without its drawbacks (see environmental impact). the domestic pig (sus scrofa domesticus) is usually given the scientific name sus scrofa, although some taxonomists call it s. domesticus, reserving s. scrofa for the wild boar. it was domesticated approximately 5,000 to 7,000 years ago. the upper canines form sharp distinctive tusks that curve outward and upward. compared to other artiodactyles, their head is relatively long, pointed, and free of warts. their head and body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m (35 to 71 in) and they can weigh between 50 and 350 kg (110 and 770 lb). in november 2012, scientists managed to sequence the genome of the domestic pig. the similarities between the pig and human genomes mean that the new data may have wide applications in the study and treatment of human genetic diseases.[28][29][30] in august 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication. the process of domestication was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms. the study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported. the study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in western asia and china, with western asian pigs introduced into europe where they crossed with wild boar. a model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the pleistocene. the study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at dna loci that affect behavior and morphology. the study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created domestication islands in the genome. the same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.[31] [32] pigs have been important in culture across the world since neolithic times. they appear in art, literature, and religion. in asia the wild boar is one of 12 animal images comprising the chinese zodiac, while in europe the boar represents a standard charge in heraldry. in islam and judaism pigs and those who handle them are viewed negatively, and the consumption of pork is forbidden.[33][34] pigs are alluded to in animal epithets and proverbs.[35][36] the pig has been celebrated throughout europe since ancient times in its carnivals, the name coming from the italian carne levare, the lifting of meat.[37] pigs have been brought into literature for varying reasons, ranging from the pleasures of eating, as in charles lamb's a dissertation upon roast pig, to william golding's lord of the flies (with the fat character ""piggy""), where the rotting boar's head on a stick represents beelzebub, ""lord of the flies"" being the direct translation of the hebrew בעל זבוב, and george orwell's allegorical novel animal farm, where the central characters, representing soviet leaders, are all pigs.[38][39][40][37] domestic pigs that have escaped from urban areas or were allowed to forage in the wild, and in some cases wild boars which were introduced as prey for hunting, have given rise to large populations of feral pigs in north and south america, australia, new zealand, hawaii, and other areas where pigs are not native. accidental or deliberate releases of pigs into countries or environments where they are an alien species have caused extensive environmental change. their omnivorous diet, aggressive behaviour, and their feeding method of rooting in the ground all combine to severely alter ecosystems unused to pigs. pigs will even eat small animals and destroy nests of ground nesting birds.[8] the invasive species specialist group lists feral pigs on the list of the world's 100 worst invasive species and says:[41] feral pigs like other introduced mammals are major drivers of extinction and ecosystem change. they have been introduced into many parts of the world, and will damage crops and home gardens as well as potentially spreading disease. they uproot large areas of land, eliminating native vegetation and spreading weeds. this results in habitat alteration, a change in plant succession and composition and a decrease in native fauna dependent on the original habitat. because of the biological similarities between each other, pigs can harbour a range of parasites and diseases that can be transmitted to humans. these include trichinosis, taenia solium, cysticercosis, and brucellosis. pigs are also known to host large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract.[42] some strains of influenza are endemic in pigs. pigs also can acquire human influenza.[further explanation needed] "
penguin," aptenodytes eudyptes eudyptula megadyptes pygoscelis spheniscus for prehistoric genera, see systematics penguins (order sphenisciformes /sfɪˈnɪsɪfɔːrmiːz/, family spheniscidae /sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː/) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. they live almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, with only one species, the galápagos penguin, found north of the equator. highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater. they spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. although almost all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as antarctica. in fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. several species are found in the temperate zone, but one species, the galápagos penguin, lives near the equator. the largest living species is the emperor penguin (aptenodytes forsteri):[1] on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). the smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33 cm (13 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb).[2] among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates. some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. these were not restricted to antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.[which?] the word penguin first appears in the 16th century as a synonym for great auk.[3] when european explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the southern hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the northern hemisphere, and named them after this bird, although they are not closely related.[4] the etymology of the word penguin is still debated. the english word is not apparently of french,[3] breton[5] or spanish[6] origin (the latter two are attributed to the french word pingouin ""auk""), but first appears in english or dutch.[3] some dictionaries suggest a derivation from welsh pen, ""head"" and gwyn, ""white"",[7] including the oxford english dictionary, the american heritage dictionary,[8] the century dictionary[8] and merriam-webster,[9] on the basis that the name was originally applied to the great auk, either because it was found on white head island (welsh: pen gwyn) in newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was black). an alternative etymology links the word to latin pinguis, which means ""fat"" or ""oil"".[10] support for this etymology can be found in the alternative germanic word for penguin, fettgans or ""fat-goose"", and the related dutch word vetgans. adult male penguins are called cocks, females hens; a group of penguins on land is a waddle, and a similar group in the water is a raft. since 1871, the latin word pinguinus has been used in scientific classification to name the genus of the great auk (pinguinus impennis, meaning ""penguin without flight feathers""),[11] which became extinct in the mid-19th century. as confirmed by a 2004 genetic study, the genus pinguinus belongs in the family of the auks (alcidae), within the order of the charadriiformes.[12][13] the birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and were so named by sailors because of their physical resemblance to the great auk. despite this resemblance, however, they are not auks and they are not closely related to the great auk.[4][11] they do not belong in the genus pinguinus, and are not classified in the same family and order as the great auks. they were classified in 1831 by bonaparte in several distinct genera within the family spheniscidae and order sphenisciformes. the number of extant penguin species is debated. depending on which authority is followed, penguin biodiversity varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the subfamily spheniscinae. some sources consider the white-flippered penguin a separate eudyptula species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the little penguin;[14][15] the actual situation seems to be more complicated.[16] similarly, it is still unclear whether the royal penguin is merely a colour morph of the macaroni penguin. the status of the rockhopper penguins is also unclear. updated after marples (1962),[17] acosta hospitaleche (2004),[18] and ksepka et al. (2006).[19] subfamily spheniscinae – modern penguins †waimanu †kumimanu †delphinornis †marambiornis †mesetaornis †perudyptes †anthropornis †palaeeudyptes †icadyptes †pachydyptes †inkayacu †kairuku †paraptenodytes spheniscinae order sphenisciformes[21] the early oligocene genus cruschedula was formerly thought to belong to spheniscidae, however reexamination of the holotype in 1943 resulted in the genus being placed in accipitridae.[25] further examination in 1980 resulted in placement as aves incertae sedis.[26] some recent sources[19][23] apply the phylogenetic taxon spheniscidae to what here is referred to as spheniscinae. furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon sphenisciformes to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon pansphenisciformes as equivalent to the linnean taxon sphenisciformes,[23] i.e., including any flying basal ""proto-penguins"" to be discovered eventually. given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian phylogeny is presently resolved, this is confusing, so the established linnean system is followed here. the evolutionary history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary biogeography. although penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the alpha taxonomy of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005;[19][24][27][28] the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now. the basal penguins lived around the time of the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event somewhere in the general area of (southern) new zealand and byrd land, antarctica.[19] due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) of today. the most recent common ancestor of penguins and their sister clade can be roughly dated to the campanian–maastrichtian boundary, around 70–68 mya.[24][28][29] what can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that, by the end of the cretaceous, the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs that follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities (see also flightless cormorant).[citation needed] the oldest known fossil penguin species is waimanu manneringi, which lived in the early paleocene epoch of new zealand, or about 62 mya.[28] while they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins, waimanu were generally loon-like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving.[28] they swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were – as opposed to most other diving birds (both living and extinct) – already adapting to underwater locomotion.[30] perudyptes from northern peru was dated to 42 mya. an unnamed fossil from argentina proves that, by the bartonian (middle eocene), some 39–38 mya,[31] primitive penguins had spread to south america and were in the process of expanding into atlantic waters.[23] during the late eocene and the early oligocene (40–30 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed. nordenskjoeld's giant penguin was the tallest, growing nearly 1.80 meters (5.9 feet) tall. the new zealand giant penguin was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. both were found on new zealand, the former also in the antarctic farther eastwards. traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the paraphyletic subfamily called palaeeudyptinae. more recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the phylogeny if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. one or two closely related ones occurred in patagonia, and at least one other—which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today – occurred on most antarctic and subantarctic coasts. but size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin radiation: on seymour island, antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the priabonian (late eocene).[32] it is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted palaeeudyptinae and the anthropornithinae – whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually done these days (i.e., including anthropornis nordenskjoeldi).[19] the oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot (1.5 m)-tall icadyptes salasi, actually occurred as far north as northern peru about 36 mya. in any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the paleogene, around 25 mya. their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful.[24] a new lineage, the paraptenodytes, which includes smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost south america by that time. the early neogene saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly sized but more gracile palaeospheniscinae, as well as the radiation that gave rise to the penguin biodiversity of our time. modern penguins constitute two undisputed clades and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships.[27] to help resolve the evolution of this order, 19 high-coverage genomes that, together with 2 previously published genomes, encompass all extant penguin species have been sequenced.[33] the origin of the spheniscinae lies probably in the latest paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the australia-new zealand region and the antarctic.[24] presumably diverging from other penguins around 40 mya,[24] it seems that the spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the antarctic peninsula and patagonia have not yielded paleogene fossils of the subfamily. also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution. the genus aptenodytes appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins[19][34] they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. this genus has a distribution centred on the antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today. pygoscelis contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centred on antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. in external morphology, these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the spheniscinae, as aptenodytes' autapomorphies are in most cases fairly pronounced adaptations related to that genus' extreme habitat conditions. as the former genus, pygoscelis seems to have diverged during the bartonian,[35] but the range expansion and radiation that led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the burdigalian stage of the early miocene, roughly 20–15 mya.[24] the genera spheniscus and eudyptula contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centred on south america; some, however, range quite far northwards. they all lack carotenoid colouration and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. this group probably radiated eastwards with the antarctic circumpolar current out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the chattian (late oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya.[24] while the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a pliocene radiation, taking place some 4–2 mya.[24] the megadyptes–eudyptes clade occurs at similar latitudes (though not as far north as the galapagos penguin), has its highest diversity in the new zealand region, and represents a westward dispersal. they are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. these two genera diverged apparently in the middle miocene (langhian, roughly 15–14 mya), but again, the living species of eudyptes are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late tortonian (late miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the pliocene.[24] the geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global cooling documented in the paleoclimatic record.[24] the emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the ice ages some 35 million years later. with habitat on the antarctic coasts declining, by the priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather than in antarctica itself.[36] notably, the cold antarctic circumpolar current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of spheniscus to south america and eventually beyond.[24] despite this, there is no fossil evidence to support the idea of crown radiation from the antarctic continent in the paleogene, although dna study favors such a radiation.[36] later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the middle miocene climate transition, a sharp drop in global average temperature from 14–12 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the tortonian, the antarctic ice sheet was already much like today in volume and extent. the emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of neogene climate shifts. penguin ancestry beyond waimanu remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. the latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and grebes is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies. on the other hand, different dna sequence datasets do not agree in detail with each other either. what seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of neoaves (living birds except paleognaths and fowl) that comprises what is sometimes called ""higher waterbirds"" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl. this group contains such birds as storks, rails, and the seabirds, with the possible exception of the charadriiformes.[37] inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to ciconiiformes[28] or to procellariiformes[24] has been suggested. some think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of anhingas and cormorants) may actually be a sister group of the penguins and those penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional pelecaniformes in three.[38] a 2014 analysis of whole genomes of 48 representative bird species has concluded that penguins are the sister group of procellariiformes,[39] from which they diverged about 60 million years ago (95% ci, 56.8-62.7).[40] the distantly related puffins, which live in the north pacific and north atlantic, developed similar characteristics to survive in the arctic and sub-arctic environments. like the penguins, puffins have a white chest, black back and short stubby wings providing excellent swimming ability in icy water. but, unlike penguins, puffins can fly, as flightless birds would not survive alongside land-based predators such as polar bears and foxes; there are no such predators in the antarctic. their similarities indicate that similar environments, although at great distances, can result in similar evolutionary developments, i.e. convergent evolution.[41] penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight in the air. in the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. penguins' swimming looks very similar to bird's flight in the air.[42][failed verification] within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. the air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. on land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance. all penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts.[43] a predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. the dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above. diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are more realistic in the case of startled flight).[citation needed] the small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. dives of the large emperor penguin have been recorded reaching a depth of 565 m (1,854 ft) for up to 22 minutes.[citation needed] penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow while using their feet to propel and steer themselves, a movement called ""tobogganing"", which conserves energy while moving quickly. they also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain. penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds;[44] this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies.[45] their eyes are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this hypothesis.[46] penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers that keeps them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). the emperor penguin has a maximum feather density of about nine feathers per square centimeter which is actually much lower than other birds that live in antarctic environments. however, they have been identified as having at least four different types of feather: in addition to the traditional feather, the emperor has afterfeathers, plumules, and filoplumes. the afterfeathers are downy plumes that attach directly to the main feathers and were once believed to account for the bird's ability to conserve heat when under water; the plumules are small down feathers that attach directly to the skin, and are much more dense in penguins than other birds; lastly the filoplumes are small (less than 1 cm long) naked shafts that end in a splay of fibers— filoplumes were believed to give flying birds a sense of where their plumage was and whether or not it needed preening, so their presence in penguins may seem inconsistent, but penguins also preen extensively.[47] the emperor penguin has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. they also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. in the extreme cold of the antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. they often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the centre of the heat pack. calculations of the heat loss and retention ability of marine endotherms [48] suggest that most extant penguins are too small to survive in such cold environments.[49] in 2007, thomas and fordyce wrote about the ""heterothermic loophole"" that penguins utilize in order to survive in antarctica.[50] all extant penguins, even those that live in warmer climates, have a counter-current heat exchanger called the humeral plexus. the flippers of penguins have at least three branches of the axillary artery, which allows cold blood to be heated by blood that has already been warmed and limits heat loss from the flippers. this system allows penguins to efficiently use their body heat and explains why such small animals can survive in the extreme cold.[51] they can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream.[52][53][54] the salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages. the great auk of the northern hemisphere, now extinct, was superficially similar to penguins, and the word penguin was originally used for that bird, centuries ago. they are only distantly related to the penguins, but are an example of convergent evolution.[55] perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. these are called isabelline penguins. isabellinism is different from albinism. isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep and are often passed over as mates. although almost all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as antarctica. in fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. several species live in the temperate zone;[56][failed verification] one, the galápagos penguin, lives as far north as the galápagos islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the antarctic humboldt current that flows around these islands.[57] also, though the climate of the arctic and antarctic regions is similar, there are no penguins found in the arctic.[58] several authors have suggested that penguins are a good example of bergmann's rule[59][60] where larger bodied populations live at higher latitudes than smaller bodied populations. there is some disagreement about this, and several other authors have noted that there are fossil penguin species that contradict this hypothesis and that ocean currents and upwellings are likely to have had a greater effect on species diversity than latitude alone.[61][62] major populations of penguins are found in angola, antarctica, argentina, australia, chile, namibia, new zealand, and south africa.[63][64] satellite images and photos released in 2018 show the population of two million in france's remote ile aux cochons has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published in antarctic science.[65] penguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the yellow-eyed and fiordland species; these colonies may range in size from as few as a 100 pairs for gentoo penguins, to several hundred thousand in the case of king, macaroni and chinstrap penguins.[66] living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual as well as vocal displays in all penguin species.[67] agonistic displays are those intended to confront or drive off, or alternately appease and avoid conflict with, other individuals.[67] penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, although the two largest species, the emperor and the king penguins, lay only one.[68] with the exception of the emperor penguin, where the male does it all, all penguins share the incubation duties.[69] these incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea. penguins generally only lay one brood; the exception is the little penguin, which can raise two or three broods in a season.[70] penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at 52 g (2 oz), the little penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers' weight, and the 450 g (1 lb) emperor penguin egg is 2.3%.[68] the relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to reduce the effects of dehydration and to minimize the risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment.[71] the yolk, too, is large, and comprises 22–31% of the egg. some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain the chick if the parents are delayed in returning with food.[72] when emperor penguin mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to ""steal"" another mother's chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick.[73] in some species, such as king and emperor penguins, the chicks assemble in large groups called crèches. the majority of living penguin species have declining populations. according to the iucn red list, their conservation statuses range from least concerned through to endangered. penguins have no special fear of humans, and will often approach groups of people. this is probably because penguins have no land predators in antarctica or the nearby offshore islands. dogs preyed upon penguins while they were allowed in antarctica during the age of early human exploration as sled dogs, but dogs have long since been banned from antarctica.[92] instead, adult penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as sharks, orcas, and leopard seals. typically, penguins do not approach closer than around 9 feet (3 meters), at which point they appear to become nervous.[citation needed] in june 2011, an emperor penguin came ashore on new zealand's peka peka beach, 3200 km off course on its journey to antarctica.[93] nicknamed happy feet, after the movie of the same name, it was suffering from heat exhaustion and had to undergo a number of operations to remove objects like driftwood and sand from its stomach.[94] happy feet was a media sensation, with extensive coverage on tv and the web, including a live stream that had thousands of views[95] and a visit from english actor stephen fry.[96] once he had recovered, happy feet was released back into the water south of new zealand.[97] penguins are widely considered endearing for their unusually upright, waddling gait, swimming ability and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. their black-and-white plumage is often likened to a white tie suit. some artists and writers have penguins based at the north pole, but there are no wild penguins in the arctic. the cartoon series chilly willy helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interact with arctic or subarctic species, such as polar bears and walruses. penguins have been the subject of many books and films, such as happy feet, surf's up and the penguins of madagascar, all cgi films; march of the penguins, a documentary based on the migration process of the emperor penguin; and a parody titled farce of the penguins. mr. popper's penguins is a children's book written by richard and florence atwater; it was named a newbery honor book in 1939. penguins have also appeared in a number of cartoons and television dramas, including pingu, created by silvio mazzola in 1986 and covering more than 100 short episodes. at the end of 2009, entertainment weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, ""best-of"" list, saying, ""whether they were walking (march of the penguins), dancing (happy feet), or hanging ten (surf's up), these oddly adorable birds took flight at the box office all decade long.""[98] a video game called pengo was released by sega in 1982. set in antarctica, the player controls a penguin character who must navigate mazes of ice cubes. the player is rewarded with cut-scenes of animated penguins marching, dancing, saluting and playing peekaboo. several remakes and enhanced editions have followed, most recently in 2012. penguins are also sometimes depicted in music.[99] in 1941, dc comics introduced the avian-themed character of the penguin as a supervillain adversary of the superhero batman (detective comics #58). he became one of the most enduring enemies in batman's rogue's gallery. in the 60s batman tv series, as played by burgess meredith, he was one of the most popular characters, and in tim burton's reimagining of the character in the 1992 film batman returns, he employed an actual army of penguins (mostly african penguins). several pro, minor, college and high school sport teams in the united states have named themselves after the species, including the pittsburgh penguins team in the national hockey league and the youngstown state penguins in college athletics. penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of uk cartoonist steve bell in his strip in the guardian newspaper, particularly during and following the falklands war. opus the penguin, from the cartoons of berkeley breathed, is also described as hailing from the falklands. opus was a comical, ""existentialist"" penguin character in the cartoons bloom county, outland and opus. he was also the star in the christmas show a wish for wings that work. in the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting homosexual couples. a children's book, and tango makes three, was written about one such penguin family in the new york zoo. "
rabbit," rabbits are small mammals in the family leporidae of the order lagomorpha (along with the hare and the pika). oryctolagus cuniculus includes the european rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. the european rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. with its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration. although once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins, and have a number of traits rodents lack, like two extra incisors. male rabbits are called bucks; females are called does. an older term for an adult rabbit is coney (derived ultimately from the latin cuniculus), while rabbit once referred only to the young animals.[2] another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often applied informally (particularly by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. more recently, the term kit or kitten has been used to refer to a young rabbit. a group of rabbits is known as a colony or nest (or, occasionally, a warren, though this more commonly refers to where the rabbits live).[3] a group of baby rabbits produced from a single mating is referred to as a litter,[4] and a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a herd.[5] rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order rodentia (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved into a new order, lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). below are some of the genera and species of the rabbit. brachylagus idahoensispygmy rabbit nesolagus netscherisumatran striped

rabbit order lagomorpha     family leporidae family ochtonidae hares are precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision, while rabbits are altricial, born hairless and blind, and requiring closer care. hares (and cottontail rabbits) live a relatively solitary life in a simple nest above the ground, while most rabbits live in social groups in burrows or warrens. hares are generally larger than rabbits, with ears that are more elongated, and with hind legs that are larger and longer. hares have not been domesticated, while descendants of the european rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets. rabbits have long been domesticated. beginning in the middle ages, the european rabbit has been widely kept as livestock, starting in ancient rome. selective breeding has generated a wide variety of rabbit breeds, of which many (since the early 19th century) are also kept as pets. some strains of rabbit have been bred specifically as research subjects. as livestock, rabbits are bred for their meat and fur. the earliest breeds were important sources of meat, and so became larger than wild rabbits, but domestic rabbits in modern times range in size from dwarf to giant. rabbit fur, prized for its softness, can be found in a broad range of coat colors and patterns, as well as lengths. the angora rabbit breed, for example, was developed for its long, silky fur, which is often hand-spun into yarn. other domestic rabbit breeds have been developed primarily for the commercial fur trade, including the rex, which has a short plush coat. because the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather. rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. this way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused.[6] carl linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under the class glires; later, they were separated as the scientific consensus is that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution. however, recent dna analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they do share a common lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often referred to together as members of the superorder glires.[7] since speed and agility are a rabbit's main defenses against predators (including the swift fox), rabbits have large hind leg bones and well developed musculature. though plantigrade at rest, rabbits are on their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade form. rabbits use their strong claws for digging and (along with their teeth) for defense.[8] each front foot has four toes plus a dewclaw. each hind foot has four toes (but no dewclaw).[9] most wild rabbits (especially compared to hares) have relatively full, egg-shaped bodies. the soft coat of the wild rabbit is agouti in coloration (or, rarely, melanistic), which aids in camouflage. the tail of the rabbit (with the exception of the cottontail species) is dark on top and white below. cottontails have white on the top of their tails.[10] as a result of the position of the eyes in its skull, the rabbit has a field of vision that encompasses nearly 360 degrees, with just a small blind spot at the bridge of the nose.[11] the anatomy of rabbits' hind limbs are structurally similar to that of other land mammals and contribute to their specialized form of locomotion. the bones of the hind limbs consist of long bones (the femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the tarsals). these bones are created through endochondral ossification during development. like most land mammals, the round head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the ox coxae. the femur articulates with the tibia, but not the fibula, which is fused to the tibia. the tibia and fibula articulate with the tarsals of the pes, commonly called the foot. the hind limbs of the rabbit are longer than the front limbs. this allows them to produce their hopping form of locomotion. longer hind limbs are more capable of producing faster speeds. hares, which have longer legs than cottontail rabbits, are able to move considerably faster.[12] rabbits stay just on their toes when moving this is called digitigrade locomotion. the hind feet have four long toes that allow for this and are webbed to prevent them from spreading when hopping.[13] rabbits do not have paw pads on their feet like most other animals that use digitigrade locomotion. instead, they have coarse compressed hair that offers protection.[14] rabbits have muscled hind legs that allow for maximum force, maneuverability, and acceleration that is divided into three main parts; foot, thigh, and leg. the hind limbs of a rabbit are an exaggerated feature, that are much longer than the forelimbs providing more force. rabbits run on their toes to gain the optimal stride during locomotion. the force put out by the hind limbs is contributed to both the structural anatomy of the fusion tibia and fibula, and muscular features.[15] bone formation and removal, from a cellular standpoint, is directly correlated to hind limb muscles. action pressure from muscles creates force that is then distributed through the skeletal structures. rabbits that generate less force, putting less stress on bones are more prone to osteoporosis due to bone rarefaction.[16] in rabbits, the more fibers in a muscle, the more resistant to fatigue. for example, hares have a greater resistance to fatigue than cottontails. the muscles of rabbit's hind limbs can be classified into four main categories: hamstrings, quadriceps, dorsiflexors, or plantar flexors. the quadriceps muscles are in charge of force production when jumping. complementing these muscles are the hamstrings which aid in short bursts of action. these muscles play off of one another in the same way as the plantar flexors and doriflexors, contributing to the generation and actions associated with force.[17] within the order lagomorphs, the ears are utilized to detect and avoid predators. in the family leporidae, the ears are typically longer than they are wide. for example, in black tailed jack rabbits, their long ears cover a greater surface area relative to their body size that allow them to detect predators from far away. contrasted to cotton tailed rabbits, their ears are smaller and shorter, requiring predators to be closer to detect them before they can flee. evolution has favored rabbits having shorter ears so the larger surface area does not cause them to lose heat in more temperate regions. the opposite can be seen in rabbits that live in hotter climates, mainly because they possess longer ears that have a larger surface area that help with dispersion of heat as well as the theory that sound does not travel well in more arid air, opposed to cooler air. therefore, longer ears are meant to aid the organism in detecting predators sooner rather than later in warmer temperatures.[18] the rabbit is characterized by its shorter ears while hares are characterized by their longer ears.[19] rabbits' ears are an important structure to aid thermoregulation and detect predators due to how the outer, middle, and inner ear muscles coordinate with one another. the ear muscles also aid in maintaining balance and movement when fleeing predators.[20] outer ear the auricle, also known as the pinna, is a rabbit's outer ear.[21] the rabbit's pinnae represent a fair part of the body surface area. it is theorized that the ears aid in dispersion of heat at temperatures above 30 °c with rabbits in warmer climates having longer pinnae due to this. another theory is that the ears function as shock absorbers that could aid and stabilize rabbit's vision when fleeing predators, but this has typically only been seen in hares.[22] the rest of the outer ear has bent canals that lead to the eardrum or tympanic membrane.[23] middle ear the middle ear is filled with three bones called ossicles and is separated by the outer eardrum in the back of the rabbit's skull. the three ossicles are called hammer, anvil, and stirrup and act to decrease sound before it hits the inner ear. in general, the ossicles act as a barrier to the inner ear for sound energy.[23] inner ear inner ear fluid called endolymph receives the sound energy. after receiving the energy, later within the inner ear there are two parts: the cochlea that utilizes sound waves from the ossicles and the vestibular apparatus that manages the rabbit's position in regards to movement. within the cochlea there is a basilar membrane that contains sensory hair structures utilized to send nerve signals to the brain so it can recognize different sound frequencies. within the vestibular apparatus the rabbit possesses three semicircular canals to help detect angular motion.[23] thermoregulation is the process that an organism utilizes to maintain an optimal body temperature independent of external conditions.[24] this process is carried out by the pinnae which takes up most of the rabbit's body surface and contain a vascular network and arteriovenous shunts.[25] in a rabbit, the optimal body temperature is around 38.5–40℃.[26] if their body temperature exceeds or does not meet this optimal temperature, the rabbit must return to homeostasis. homeostasis of body temperature is maintained by the use of their large, highly vascularized ears that are able to change the amount of blood flow that passes through the ears. constriction and dilation of blood vessels in the ears are used to control the core body temperature of a rabbit. if the core temperature exceeds its optimal temperature greatly, blood flow is constricted to limit the amount of blood going through the vessels. with this constriction, there is only a limited amount of blood that is passing through the ears where ambient heat would be able to heat the blood that is flowing through the ears and therefore, increasing the body temperature. constriction is also used when the ambient temperature is much lower than that of the rabbit's core body temperature. when the ears are constricted it again limits blood flow through the ears to conserve the optimal body temperature of the rabbit. if the ambient temperature is either 15 degrees above or below the optimal body temperature, the blood vessels will dilate. with the blood vessels being enlarged, the blood is able to pass through the large surface area which causes it to either heat or cool down. during the summer, the rabbit has the capability to stretch its pinnae which allows for greater surface area and increase heat dissipation. in the winter, the rabbit does the opposite and folds its ears in order to decrease its surface area to the ambient air which would decrease their body temperature. the jackrabbit has the largest ears within the oryctolagus cuniculus group. their ears contribute to 17% of their total body surface area. their large pinna were evolved to maintain homeostasis while in the extreme temperatures of the desert. the rabbit's nasal cavity lies dorsal to the oral cavity, and the two compartments are separated by the hard and soft palate.[27] the nasal cavity itself is separated into a left and right side by a cartilage barrier, and it is covered in fine hairs that trap dust before it can enter the respiratory tract.[28][27] as the rabbit breathes, air flows in through the nostrils along the alar folds. from there, the air moves into the nasal cavity, also known as the nasopharynx, down through the trachea, through the larynx, and into the lungs.[28][29] the larynx functions as the rabbit's voice box, which enables it to produce a wide variety of sounds.[28] the trachea is a long tube embedded with cartilaginous rings that prevent the tube from collapsing as air moves in and out of the lungs. the trachea then splits into a left and right bronchus, which meet the lungs at a structure called the hilum. from there, the bronchi split into progressively more narrow and numerous branches. the bronchi branch into bronchioles, into respiratory bronchioles, and ultimately terminate at the alveolar ducts. the branching that is typically found in rabbit lungs is a clear example of monopodial branching, in which smaller branches divide out laterally from a larger central branch.[30] rabbits breathe primarily through their noses due to the fact that the epiglottis is fixed to the backmost portion of the soft palate.[29] within the oral cavity, a layer of tissue sits over the opening of the glottis, which blocks airflow from the oral cavity to the trachea.[27] the epiglottis functions to prevent the rabbit from aspirating on its food. further, the presence of a soft and hard palate allow the rabbit to breathe through its nose while it feeds.[28] rabbits lungs are divided into four lobes: the cranial, middle, caudal, and accessory lobes. the right lung is made up of all four lobes, while the left lung only has two: the cranial and caudal lobes.[30] in order to provide space for the heart, the left cranial lobe of the lungs is significantly smaller than that of the right.[27] the diaphragm is a muscular structure that lies caudal to the lungs and contracts to facilitate respiration.[27][29] rabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass, forbs, and leafy weeds. in consequence, their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest. rabbits solve this problem via a form of hindgut fermentation. they pass two distinct types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs or ""night droppings"" [31] and are immediately eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy). rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cows and numerous other herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.[32] rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding.[citation needed] in this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested.[citation needed] if the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals.[citation needed] while out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced.[citation needed] hard pellets are made up of hay-like fragments of plant cuticle and stalk, being the final waste product after redigestion of soft pellets. these are only released outside the burrow and are not reingested. soft pellets are usually produced several hours after grazing, after the hard pellets have all been excreted.[citation needed] they are made up of micro-organisms and undigested plant cell walls.[citation needed] rabbits are hindgut digesters. this means that most of their digestion takes place in their large intestine and cecum. in rabbits, the cecum is about 10 times bigger than the stomach and it along with the large intestine makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract.[33] the unique musculature of the cecum allows the intestinal tract of the rabbit to separate fibrous material from more digestible material; the fibrous material is passed as feces, while the more nutritious material is encased in a mucous lining as a cecotrope. cecotropes, sometimes called ""night feces"", are high in minerals, vitamins and proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's health. rabbits eat these to meet their nutritional requirements; the mucous coating allows the nutrients to pass through the acidic stomach for digestion in the intestines. this process allows rabbits to extract the necessary nutrients from their food.[34] the chewed plant material collects in the large cecum, a secondary chamber between the large and small intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain b vitamins. the pellets are about 56% bacteria by dry weight, largely accounting for the pellets being 24.4% protein on average. the soft feces form here and contain up to five times the vitamins of hard feces. after being excreted, they are eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the stomach. the pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. this double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat.[10] this process serves the same purpose in the rabbit as rumination does in cattle and sheep.[35] rabbits are incapable of vomiting.[36] because rabbits cannot vomit, if buildup occurs within the intestines (due often to a diet with insufficient fiber[37]), intestinal blockage can occur.[38] the adult male reproductive system forms the same as most mammals with the seminiferous tubular compartment containing the sertoli cells and an adluminal compartment that contains the leydig cells.[39] the leydig cells produce testosterone, which maintains libido[39] and creates secondary sex characteristics such as the genital tubercle and penis. the sertoli cells triggers the production of anti-müllerian duct hormone, which absorbs the müllerian duct. in an adult male rabbit, the sheath of the penis is cylinder-like and can be extruded as early as two months of age.[40] the scrotal sacs lay lateral to the penis and contain epididymal fat pads which protect the testes. between 10 and 14 weeks, the testes descend and are able to retract into the pelvic cavity in order to thermoregulate.[40] furthermore, the secondary sex characteristics, such as the testes, are complex and secrete many compounds. these compounds includes fructose, citric acid, minerals, and a uniquely high amount of catalase.[39] the adult female reproductive tract is bipartite, which prevents an embryo from translocating between uteri.[41] the two uterine horns communicate to two cervixes and forms one vaginal canal. along with being bipartite, the female rabbit does not go through an estrus cycle, which causes mating induced ovulation.[40] the average female rabbit becomes sexually mature at 3 to 8 months of age and can conceive at any time of the year for the duration of her life. however, egg and sperm production can begin to decline after three years.[39] during mating, the male rabbit will mount the female rabbit from behind and insert his penis into the female and make rapid pelvic hip thrusts. the encounter lasts only 20–40 seconds and after, the male will throw himself backwards off the female.[42] the rabbit gestation period is short and ranges from 28 to 36 days with an average period of 31 days. a longer gestation period will generally yield a smaller litter while shorter gestation periods will give birth to a larger litter. the size of a single litter can range from four to 12 kits allowing a female to deliver up to 60 new kits a year. after birth, the female can become pregnant again as early as the next day.[40] the mortality rates of embryos are high in rabbits and can be due to infection, trauma, poor nutrition and environmental stress so a high fertility rate is necessary to counter this.[40] rabbits may appear to be crepuscular, but their natural inclination is toward nocturnal activity.[43] in 2011, the average sleep time of a rabbit in captivity was calculated at 8.4 hours per day.[44] as with other prey animals, rabbits often sleep with their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit to respond to potential danger.[45] in addition to being at risk of disease from common pathogens such as bordetella bronchiseptica and escherichia coli, rabbits can contract the virulent, species-specific viruses rhd (""rabbit hemorrhagic disease"", a form of calicivirus)[46] or myxomatosis. among the parasites that infect rabbits are tapeworms (such as taenia serialis), external parasites (including fleas and mites), coccidia species, and toxoplasma gondii.[47][48] domesticated rabbits with a diet lacking in high fiber sources, such as hay and grass, are susceptible to potentially lethal gastrointestinal stasis.[49] rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.[50] encephalitozoon cuniculi, an obligate intracellular parasite is also capable of infecting many mammals including rabbits. rabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their surroundings. for instance, in mediterranean europe, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and iberian lynxes.[51] if confronted by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground. rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead scanning.[52] they survive predation by burrowing, hopping away in a zig-zag motion, and, if captured, delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs. their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite in order to escape a struggle.[53] the longest-lived rabbit on record, a domesticated european rabbit living in tasmania, died at age 18.[54] the lifespan of wild rabbits is much shorter; the average longevity of an eastern cottontail, for instance, is less than one year.[55] rabbit habitats include meadows, woods, forests, grasslands, deserts and wetlands.[56] rabbits live in groups, and the best known species, the european rabbit, lives in burrows, or rabbit holes. a group of burrows is called a warren.[56] more than half the world's rabbit population resides in north america.[56] they are also native to southwestern europe, southeast asia, sumatra, some islands of japan, and in parts of africa and south america. they are not naturally found in most of eurasia, where a number of species of hares are present. rabbits first entered south america relatively recently, as part of the great american interchange. much of the continent has just one species of rabbit, the tapeti, while most of south america's southern cone is without rabbits. the european rabbit has been introduced to many places around the world.[10] rabbits have been a source of environmental problems when introduced into the wild by humans. as a result of their appetites, and the rate at which they breed, feral rabbit depredation can be problematic for agriculture. gassing, barriers (fences), shooting, snaring, and ferreting have been used to control rabbit populations, but the most effective measures are diseases such as myxomatosis (myxo or mixi, colloquially) and calicivirus. in europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically modified virus. the virus was developed in spain, and is beneficial to rabbit farmers. if it were to make its way into wild populations in areas such as australia, it could create a population boom, as those diseases are the most serious threats to rabbit survival. rabbits in australia and new zealand are considered to be such a pest that land owners are legally obliged to control them.[60][61] in some areas, wild rabbits and hares are hunted for their meat, a lean source of high quality protein.[62] in the wild, such hunting is accomplished with the aid of trained falcons, ferrets, or dogs, as well as with snares or other traps, and rifles. a caught rabbit may be dispatched with a sharp blow to the back of its head, a practice from which the term rabbit punch is derived. wild leporids comprise a small portion of global rabbit-meat consumption. domesticated descendants of the european rabbit (oryctolagus cuniculus) that are bred and kept as livestock (a practice called cuniculture) account for the estimated 200 million tons of rabbit meat produced annually.[63] approximately 1.2 billion rabbits are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.[64] in 1994, the countries with the highest consumption per capita of rabbit meat were malta with 8.89 kg (19 lb 10 oz), italy with 5.71 kg (12 lb 9 oz), and cyprus with 4.37 kg (9 lb 10 oz), falling to 0.03 kg (1 oz) in japan. the figure for the united states was 0.14 kg (5 oz) per capita. the largest producers of rabbit meat in 1994 were china, russia, italy, france, and spain.[65] rabbit meat was once a common commodity in sydney, australia, but declined after the myxomatosis virus was intentionally introduced to control the exploding population of feral rabbits in the area. in the united kingdom, fresh rabbit is sold in butcher shops and markets, and some supermarkets sell frozen rabbit meat. at farmers markets there, including the famous borough market in london, rabbit carcasses are sometimes displayed hanging, unbutchered (in the traditional style), next to braces of pheasant or other small game. rabbit meat is a feature of moroccan cuisine, where it is cooked in a tajine with ""raisins and grilled almonds added a few minutes before serving"".[66] in china, rabbit meat is particularly popular in sichuan cuisine, with its stewed rabbit, spicy diced rabbit, bbq-style rabbit, and even spicy rabbit heads, which have been compared to spicy duck neck.[63] rabbit meat is comparatively unpopular elsewhere in the asia-pacific. an extremely rare infection associated with rabbits-as-food is tularemia (also known as rabbit fever), which may be contracted from an infected rabbit.[67] hunters are at higher risk for tularemia because of the potential for inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process. in addition to their meat, rabbits are used for their wool, fur, and pelts, as well as their nitrogen-rich manure and their high-protein milk.[68] production industries have developed domesticated rabbit breeds (such as the well-known angora rabbit) to efficiently fill these needs. rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and easter as the easter bunny. the species' role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and innocence, and in folklore and modern children's stories, rabbits often appear as sympathetic characters, able to connect easily with youth of all kinds (for example, the velveteen rabbit, or thumper in bambi). with its reputation as a prolific breeder, the rabbit juxtaposes sexuality with innocence, as in the playboy bunny. the rabbit (as a swift prey animal) is also known for its speed, agility, and endurance, symbolized (for example) by the marketing icons the energizer bunny and the duracell bunny. the rabbit often appears in folklore as the trickster archetype, as he uses his cunning to outwit his enemies. the rabbit as trickster is a part of american popular culture, as br'er rabbit (from african-american folktales and, later, disney animation) and bugs bunny (the cartoon character from warner bros.), for example. anthropomorphized rabbits have appeared in film and literature, in alice's adventures in wonderland (the white rabbit and the march hare characters), in watership down (including the film and television adaptations), in rabbit hill (by robert lawson), and in the peter rabbit stories (by beatrix potter). in the 1920s, oswald the lucky rabbit, was a popular cartoon character. a rabbit's foot may be carried as an amulet, believed to bring protection and good luck. this belief is found in many parts of the world, with the earliest use being recorded in europe c. 600 bc.[71] on the isle of portland in dorset, uk, the rabbit is said to be unlucky and even speaking the creature's name can cause upset among older island residents. this is thought to date back to early times in the local quarrying industry where (to save space) extracted stones that were not fit for sale were set aside in what became tall, unstable walls. the local rabbits' tendency to burrow there would weaken the walls and their collapse resulted in injuries or even death. thus, invoking the name of the culprit became an unlucky act to be avoided. in the local culture to this day, the rabbit (when he has to be referred to) may instead be called a “long ears” or “underground mutton”, so as not to risk bringing a downfall upon oneself. while it was true 50 years ago[when?] that a pub on the island could be emptied by calling out the word ""rabbit"", this has become more fable than fact in modern times.[citation needed] in other parts of britain and in north america, invoking the rabbit's name may instead bring good luck. ""rabbit rabbit rabbit"" is one variant of an apotropaic or talismanic superstition that involves saying or repeating the word ""rabbit"" (or ""rabbits"" or ""white rabbits"" or some combination thereof) out loud upon waking on the first day of each month, because doing so will ensure good fortune for the duration of that month. the ""rabbit test"" is a term, first used in 1949, for the friedman test, an early diagnostic tool for detecting a pregnancy in humans. it is a common misconception (or perhaps an urban legend) that the test-rabbit would die if the woman was pregnant. this led to the phrase ""the rabbit died"" becoming a euphemism for a positive pregnancy test. "
shark," carcharhiniformes heterodontiformes hexanchiformes lamniformes orectolobiformes pristiophoriformes squaliformes squatiniformes † cladoselachiformes † hybodontiformes † xenacanthida (xenacantiformes) † elegestolepis sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. modern sharks are classified within the clade selachimorpha (or selachii) and are the sister group to the rays. however, the term ""shark"" has also been used for extinct members of the subclass elasmobranchii outside the selachimorpha, such as cladoselache and xenacanthus, as well as other chondrichthyes such as the holocephalid eugenedontidans. under this broader definition, the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago.[2] acanthodians are often referred to as ""spiny sharks""; though they are not part of chondrichthyes proper, they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole. since then, sharks have diversified into over 500 species. they range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length, to the whale shark (rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 metres (40 ft) in length.[3] sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). they generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can be found in both seawater and freshwater.[4] sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. they have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.[5] well-known species such as the tiger shark, blue shark, great white shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and hammerhead shark are apex predators—organisms at the top of their underwater food chain. many shark populations are threatened by human activities. until the 16th century,[6] sharks were known to mariners as ""sea dogs"".[7] this is still evidential in several species termed ""dogfish,"" or the porbeagle. the etymology of the word ""shark"" is uncertain, the most likely etymology states that the original sense of the word was that of ""predator, one who preys on others"" from the dutch schurk, meaning ""villain, scoundrel"" (cf. card shark, loan shark, etc.), which was later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour.[8] a now disproven[original research?] theory is that it derives from the yucatec maya word xok (pronounced 'shok'), meaning ""fish"".[9] evidence for this etymology came from the oxford english dictionary, which notes shark first came into use after sir john hawkins' sailors exhibited one in london in 1569 and posted ""sharke"" to refer to the large sharks of the caribbean sea. however, the middle english dictionary records an isolated occurrence of the word shark (referring to a sea fish) in a letter written by thomas beckington in 1442, which rules out a new world etymology.[10][original research?] evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the ordovician period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before a variety of plants had colonized the continents.[2] only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans.[11] the oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the silurian period.[11] the first sharks looked very different from modern sharks.[12] at this time the most common shark tooth is the cladodont, a style of thin tooth with three tines like a trident, apparently to help catch fish. the majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago.[13] most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. the teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. when a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments. among the most ancient and primitive sharks is cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago,[12] which has been found within paleozoic strata in ohio, kentucky, and tennessee. at that point in earth's history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of north america. cladoselache was only about 1 metre (3.3 ft) long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws.[12] its teeth had several pointed cusps, which wore down from use. from the small number of teeth found together, it is most likely that cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and longfin makos. the presence of whole fish arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility. most fossil sharks from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups. the xenacanthida was almost exclusive to freshwater environments.[14][15] by the time this group became extinct about 220 million years ago, they had spread worldwide. the other group, the hybodonts, appeared about 320 million years ago and lived mostly in the oceans, but also in freshwater.[citation needed] the results of a 2014 study of the gill structure of an unusually well preserved 325-million-year-old fossil suggested that sharks are not ""living fossils"", but rather have evolved more extensively than previously thought over the hundreds of millions of years they have been around.[16] modern sharks began to appear about 100 million years ago.[13] fossil mackerel shark teeth date to the early cretaceous. one of the most recently evolved families is the hammerhead shark (family sphyrnidae), which emerged in the eocene.[17] the oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 66 million years ago, around the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs. in early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages: one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely serrated teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark, and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth. these sharks attained gigantic proportions and include the extinct megatoothed shark, c. megalodon. like most extinct sharks, c. megalodon is also primarily known from its fossil teeth and vertebrae. this giant shark reached a total length (tl) of more than 16 metres (52 ft).[18][19] c. megalodon may have approached a maxima of 20.3 metres (67 ft) in total length and 103 metric tons (114 short tons) in mass.[20] paleontological evidence suggests that this shark was an active predator of large cetaceans.[20] sharks belong to the superorder selachimorpha in the subclass elasmobranchii in the class chondrichthyes. the elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the chondrichthyes also include chimaeras. it was thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group: some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks,[21] but current molecular studies support monophyly of both groups of sharks and batoids.[22][23] the superorder selachimorpha is divided into galea (or galeomorphii), and squalea (or squalomorphii). the galeans are the heterodontiformes, orectolobiformes, lamniformes, and carcharhiniformes. lamnoids and carcharhinoids are usually placed in one clade, but recent studies show the lamnoids and orectoloboids are a clade. some scientists now think that heterodontoids may be squalean. the squaleans are divided into hexanchiformes and squalomorpha. the former includes cow shark and frilled shark, though some authors propose both families to be moved to separate orders. the squalomorpha contains the squaliformes and the hypnosqualea. the hypnosqualea may be invalid. it includes the squatiniformes, and the pristorajea, which may also be invalid, but includes the pristiophoriformes and the batoidea.[21][24] there are more than 470 species of sharks split across twelve orders, including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct:[24] shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. the rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. in most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.[25] tooth shape depends on the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. the teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.[26] shark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. this reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy.[27] because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.[28] the jaws of sharks, like those of rays and skates, are not attached to the cranium. the jaw's surface (in comparison to the shark's vertebrae and gill arches) needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength. it has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called ""tesserae"", which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic.[29] this gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals. generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, depending on body size. the jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers.[27] in the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts. fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers.[30] most sharks have eight fins. sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail-first direction.[28] unlike bony fish, sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. this works as an outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy.[31] their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming.[32] tails provide thrust, making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape. caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species, due to their evolution in separate environments. sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion. this is because the shark's vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. this allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish. by contrast, most bony fish possess a homocercal caudal fin.[33] tiger sharks have a large upper lobe, which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed. the tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey.[34] other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid. unlike bony fish, sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders for buoyancy. instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene, and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone.[31] their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass.[35] the liver's effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming. sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs, using it as a form of swim bladder. bottom-dwelling sharks, like the nurse shark, have negative buoyancy, allowing them to rest on the ocean floor. some sharks, if inverted or stroked on the nose, enter a natural state of tonic immobility. researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely.[36] like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills. unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head. a modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom–dwelling sharks. spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks.[26] while the shark is moving, water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as ""ram ventilation"". while at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water. a small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest. these species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move. obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species.[37][38] the respiration and circulation process begins when deoxygenated blood travels to the shark's two-chambered heart. here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral aorta artery where it branches into afferent brachial arteries. reoxygenation takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the efferent brachial arteries, which come together to form the dorsal aorta. the blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body. the deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior cardinal veins and enters the posterior cardinal sinuses. from there blood enters the heart ventricle and the cycle repeats.[39] most sharks are ""cold-blooded"" or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment. members of the family lamnidae (such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. in these sharks, a strip of aerobic red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat, which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile (""miraculous net""). the common thresher and bigeye thresher sharks have a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature.[40] in contrast to bony fish, with the exception of the coelacanth,[41] the blood and other tissue of sharks and chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea (up to 2.5%[42]) and trimethylamine n-oxide (tmao), allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater. this adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater, and they are therefore confined to marine environments. a few exceptions exist, such as the bull shark, which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea.[35] when a shark dies, the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria, causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia.[43][44] research in 1930 by homer w. smith showed that sharks' urine doesn't contain sufficient sodium to avoid hypernatremia, and it was postulated that there must be an additional mechanism for salt secretion. in 1960 it was discovered at the mount desert island biological laboratory in salsbury cove, maine that sharks have a type of salt gland located at the end of the intestine, known as the ""rectal gland"", whose function is the secretion of chlorides.[45] digestion can take a long time. the food moves from the mouth to a j-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial digestion occurs.[46] unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth.[47] one of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. this short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. the valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.[46] a few sharks appear fluorescent under blue light, such as the swell shark and the chain catshark, where the fluorophore derives from a metabolite of kynurenic acid.[48] sharks have keen olfactory senses, located in the short duct (which is not fused, unlike bony fish) between the anterior and posterior nasal openings, with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater.[49] the size of the olfactory bulb varies across different shark species, with size dependent on how much a given species relies on smell or vision to find their prey[50]. in environments with low visibility, shark species generally have larger olfactory bulbs[50]. in reefs, where visibility is high, species of sharks from the family carcharhinidae have smaller olfactory bulbs[50]. sharks found in deeper waters also have larger olfactory bulbs[51]. sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril.[52] this is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound. they are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species, and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls. some species, such as nurse sharks, have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey. shark eyes are similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, including similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment with the help of a tissue called tapetum lucidum. this tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. the effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. to protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. this membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. however, some species, including the great white shark (carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. the importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. the use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. the shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time.[53] a micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. the remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. the study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.[54] [55][56] although it is hard to test the hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey from many miles away.[57] a small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. the lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. this is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. in bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost. the ampullae of lorenzini are the electroreceptor organs. they number in the hundreds to thousands. sharks use the ampullae of lorenzini to detect the electromagnetic fields that all living things produce.[58] this helps sharks (particularly the hammerhead shark) find prey. the shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation.[59] this system is found in most fish, including sharks. it is a tactile sensory system which allows the organism to detect water speed and pressure changes near by.[60] the main component of the system is the neuromast, a cell similar to hair cells present in the vertebrate ear that interact with the surrounding aquatic environment. this helps sharks distinguish between the currents around them, obstacles off on their periphery, and struggling prey out of visual view. the shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 hz.[61] shark lifespans vary by species. most live 20 to 30 years. the spiny dogfish has one of the longest lifespans at more than 100 years.[62] whale sharks (rhincodon typus) may also live over 100 years.[63] earlier estimates suggested the greenland shark (somniosus microcephalus) could reach about 200 years, but a recent study found that a 5.02-metre-long (16.5 ft) specimen was 392 ± 120 years old (i.e., at least 272 years old), making it the longest-lived vertebrate known.[64][65] unlike most bony fish, sharks are k-selected reproducers, meaning that they produce a small number of well-developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle.[66] sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish. for example, lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13–15.[67] sharks practice internal fertilization.[68] the posterior part of a male shark's pelvic fins are modified into a pair of intromittent organs called claspers, analogous to a mammalian penis, of which one is used to deliver sperm into the female.[69] mating has rarely been observed in sharks.[70] the smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. in less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. the bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to show his interest. in some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.[69] there have been a number of documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through parthenogenesis.[71][72] the details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the pups had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. the extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown. mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed. scientists say that asexual reproduction in the wild is rare, and probably a last-ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present. asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity, which helps build defenses against threats to the species. species that rely solely on it risk extinction. asexual reproduction may have contributed to the blue shark's decline off the irish coast.[73] sharks display three ways to bear their young, varying by species, oviparity, viviparity and ovoviviparity.[74][75] most sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning that the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother's body and that the egg's yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos. the young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. as in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. lamniforme sharks practice oophagy, where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs. taking this a step further, sand tiger shark pups cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos. the survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth. the whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. they choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.[74] some species are oviparous, laying their fertilized eggs in the water. in most oviparous shark species, an egg case with the consistency of leather protects the developing embryo(s). these cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. the egg case is commonly called a mermaid's purse. oviparous sharks include the horn shark, catshark, port jackson shark, and swellshark.[74][76] viviparity is the gestation of young without the use of a traditional egg, and results in live birth.[77] viviparity in sharks can be placental or aplacental.[77] young are born fully formed and self-sufficient.[77] hammerheads, the requiem sharks (such as the bull and blue sharks), and smoothhounds are viviparous.[66][74] the classic view describes a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans in search of food. however, this applies to only a few species. most live far more social, sedentary, benthic lives, and appear likely to have their own distinct personalities.[78] even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year.[79] shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds, with many sharks covering entire ocean basins. sharks can be highly social, remaining in large schools. sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands, e.g., in the gulf of california.[35] cross-species social hierarchies exist. for example, oceanic whitetip sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding.[66] when approached too closely some sharks perform a threat display. this usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements, and can vary in intensity according to the threat level.[80] in general, sharks swim (""cruise"") at an average speed of 8 kilometres per hour (5.0 mph), but when feeding or attacking, the average shark can reach speeds upwards of 19 kilometres per hour (12 mph). the shortfin mako shark, the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish, can burst at speeds up to 50 kilometres per hour (31 mph).[81] the great white shark is also capable of speed bursts. these exceptions may be due to the warm-blooded, or homeothermic, nature of these sharks' physiology. sharks can travel 70 to 80 km in a day.[82] sharks possess brain-to-body mass ratios that are similar to mammals and birds,[83] and have exhibited apparent curiosity and behavior resembling play in the wild.[84][85] there is evidence that juvenile lemon sharks can use observational learning in their investigation of novel objects in their environment.[86] all sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe; however, not all species need to be moving to do this. those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. it has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them[87] and as such they are not truly asleep. species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. it is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species.[87] in 2016 a great white shark was captured on video for the first time in a state researchers believed was sleep swimming.[88] most sharks are carnivorous.[89] basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. this type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. the shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls. teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding.[89] other highly specialized feeders include cookiecutter sharks, which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals. cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animal's size. the lower teeth are particularly sharp. although they have never been observed feeding, they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal, twisting their bodies to rip off flesh.[35] some seabed–dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators. angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths.[90] many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth. other sharks feed on squid or fish, which they swallow whole. the viper dogfish has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. the great white and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra. many sharks, including the whitetip reef shark are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey. these social sharks are often migratory, traveling huge distances around ocean basins in large schools. these migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources.[91] sharks are found in all seas. they generally do not live in fresh water, with a few exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark which can swim both in seawater and freshwater.[92] sharks are common down to depths of 2,000 metres (7,000 ft), and some live even deeper, but they are almost entirely absent below 3,000 metres (10,000 ft). the deepest confirmed report of a shark is a portuguese dogfish at 3,700 metres (12,100 ft).[93] in 2006 the international shark attack file (isaf) undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks, confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks. the average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4.3.[94] contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks.[95][96] these sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.[97] the perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the jersey shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the jaws film series. jaws author peter benchley, as well as jaws director steven spielberg, later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.[98] to help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much.[99] in general, sharks show little pattern of attacking humans specifically. research indicates that when humans do become the object of a shark attack, it is possible that the shark has mistaken the human for species that are its normal prey, such as seals.[100][101] until recently, only a few benthic species of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and catsharks, had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more. this gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. more knowledge has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation.[102] the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long periods of time until september 2004, when the monterey bay aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her. most species are not suitable for home aquaria, and not every species sold by pet stores are appropriate. some species can flourish in home saltwater aquaria.[103] uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the nurse shark, which upon reaching adulthood is far too large for typical home aquaria.[103] public aquaria generally do not accept donated specimens that have outgrown their housing. some owners have been tempted to release them.[103] species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet (90 cm) and can live up to 25 years.[103] sharks figure prominently in hawaiian mythology. stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. a common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. the beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. among a fishing people, the most popular of all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. the body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. the ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. many native hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.[104] kamohoali'i is the best known and revered of the shark gods, he was the older and favored brother of pele,[105] and helped and journeyed with her to hawaii. he was able to assume all human and fish forms. a summit cliff on the crater of kilauea is one of his most sacred spots. at one point he had a heiau (temple or shrine) dedicated to him on every piece of land that jutted into the ocean on the island of molokai. kamohoali'i was an ancestral god, not a human who became a shark and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself.[106][107] in fijian mythology, dakuwaqa was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls. on the island of tutuila in american samoa (a u.s. territory), there is a location called turtle and shark (laumei ma malie) which is important in samoan culture — the location is the site of a legend called o le tala i le laumei ma le malie, in which two humans are said to have transformed into a turtle and a shark.[108][109][110] according to the u.s. national park service, ""villagers from nearby vaitogi continue to reenact an important aspect of the legend at turtle and shark by performing a ritual song intended to summon the legendary animals to the ocean surface, and visitors are frequently amazed to see one or both of these creatures emerge from the sea in apparent response to this call.""[108] in contrast to the complex portrayals by hawaiians and other pacific islanders, the european and western view of sharks has historically been mostly of fear and malevolence.[111] sharks are used in popular culture commonly as eating machines, notably in the jaws novel and the film of the same name, along with its sequels.[112] sharks are threats in other films such as deep blue sea, the reef, and others, although they are sometimes used for comedic effect such as in finding nemo and the austin powers series. sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean. such examples include the tom and jerry cartoons, jabberjaw, and other shows produced by hanna-barbera. they also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters.[citation needed] a popular myth is that sharks are immune to disease and cancer, but this is not scientifically supported. sharks have been known to get cancer.[113][114] both diseases and parasites affect sharks. the evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.[115] other apparently false claims are that fins prevent cancer[116] and treat osteoarthritis.[117] no scientific proof supports these claims; at least one study has shown shark cartilage of no value in cancer treatment.[118] it is estimated that 100 million sharks are killed by people every year, due to commercial and recreational fishing.[119][120] shark finning yields are estimated at 1.44 million metric tons for 2000, and 1.41 million tons for 2010. based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year.[121][122] sharks are a common seafood in many places, including japan and australia. in the australian state of victoria, shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips,[citation needed] in which fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled. in fish and chip shops, shark is called flake. in india, small sharks or baby sharks (called sora in tamil language, telugu language) are sold in local markets. since the flesh is not developed, cooking the flesh breaks it into powder, which is then fried in oil and spices (called sora puttu/sora poratu). the soft bones can be easily chewed. they are considered a delicacy in coastal tamil nadu. icelanders ferment greenland sharks to produce a delicacy called hákarl.[123] during a four-year period from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets.[124] sharks are often killed for shark fin soup. fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal back into the water. shark finning involves removing the fin with a hot metal blade.[120] the resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators.[125] shark fin has become a major trade within black markets all over the world. fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009.[126] poachers illegally fin millions each year. few governments enforce laws that protect them.[122] in 2010 hawaii became the first u.s. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins.[127] from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins.[124] it is estimated by traffic that over 14,000 tonnes of shark fins were exported into singapore between 2005–2007 and 2012–2014.[128] shark fin soup is a status symbol in asian countries and is erroneously considered healthy and full of nutrients. scientific research has revealed, however, that high concentrations of bmaa are present in shark fins.[129] because bmaa is a neurotoxin, consumption of shark fin soup and cartilage pills, therefore, may pose a health risk.[130] bmaa is under study for its pathological role in neurodegegerative diseases such as, als, alzheimer's disease, and parkinson's disease. sharks are also killed for meat. european diners consume dogfishes, smoothhounds, catsharks, makos, porbeagle and also skates and rays.[131] however, the u.s. fda lists sharks as one of four fish (with swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish) whose high mercury content is hazardous to children and pregnant women. sharks generally reach sexual maturity only after many years and produce few offspring in comparison to other harvested fish. harvesting sharks before they reproduce severely impacts future populations. capture induced premature birth and abortion (collectively called capture-induced parturition) occurs frequently in sharks/rays when fished.[68] capture-induced parturition is rarely considered in fisheries management despite being shown to occur in at least 12% of live bearing sharks and rays (88 species to date).[68] the majority of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. the rise in demand for shark products increases pressure on fisheries.[36] major declines in shark stocks have been recorded—some species have been depleted by over 90% over the past 20–30 years with population declines of 70% not unusual.[132] a study by the international union for conservation of nature suggests that one quarter of all known species of sharks and rays are threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered.[133][134] in 2014, a shark cull in western australia killed dozens of sharks (mostly tiger sharks) using drum lines,[135] until it was cancelled after public protests and a decision by the western australia epa; from 2014 to 2017, there was an ""imminent threat"" policy in western australia in which sharks that ""threatened"" humans in the ocean were shot and killed.[136] this ""imminent threat"" policy was criticized by senator rachel siewart for killing endangered sharks.[137] the ""imminent threat"" policy was cancelled in march 2017.[138] in august 2018, the western australia government announced a plan to re-introduce drum lines (though, this time the drum lines are ""smart"" drum lines).[139] from 1962 to the present,[140] the government of queensland has targeted and killed sharks in large numbers by using drum lines, under a ""shark control"" program—this program has also inadvertently killed large numbers of other animals such as dolphins; it has also killed endangered hammerhead sharks.[141][142][143][144] queensland's drum line program has been called ""outdated, cruel and ineffective"".[144] from 2001 to 2018, a total of 10,480 sharks were killed on lethal drum lines in queensland, including in the great barrier reef.[145] from 1962 to 2018, roughly 50,000 sharks were killed by queensland authorities.[146] the government of new south wales has a program that deliberately kills sharks using nets.[143][147] the current net program in new south wales has been described as being ""extremely destructive"" to marine life, including sharks.[148] between 1950 and 2008, 352 tiger sharks and 577 great white sharks were killed in the nets in new south wales — also during this period, a total of 15,135 marine animals were killed in the nets, including dolphins, whales, turtles, dugongs, and critically endangered grey nurse sharks.[149] there has been a very large decrease in the number of sharks in eastern australia, and the shark-killing programs in queensland and new south wales are partly responsible for this decrease.[146] kwazulu-natal, an area of south africa, has a shark-killing program using nets and drum lines—these nets and drum lines have killed turtles and dolphins, and have been criticized for killing wildlife.[150] during a 30-year period, more than 33,000 sharks have been killed in kwazulu-natal's shark-killing program — during the same 30-year period, 2,211 turtles, 8,448 rays, and 2,310 dolphins were killed in kwazulu-natal.[150] authorities on the french island of réunion kill about 100 sharks per year.[151] killing sharks negatively affects the marine ecosystem.[152][153] jessica morris of humane society international calls shark culling a ""knee-jerk reaction"" and says, ""sharks are top order predators that play an important role in the functioning of marine ecosystems. we need them for healthy oceans.""[154] george h. burgess, the former[155] director of the international shark attack file, ""describes [shark] culling as a form of revenge, satisfying a public demand for blood and little else"";[156] he also said shark culling is a ""retro-type move reminiscent of what people would have done in the 1940s and 50s, back when we didn't have an ecological conscience and before we knew the consequences of our actions.""[156] jane williamson, an associate professor in marine ecology at macquarie university, says ""there is no scientific support for the concept that culling sharks in a particular area will lead to a decrease in shark attacks and increase ocean safety.""[157] other threats include habitat alteration, damage and loss from coastal development, pollution and the impact of fisheries on the seabed and prey species.[158] the 2007 documentary sharkwater exposed how sharks are being hunted to extinction.[159] in 1991, south africa was the first country in the world to declare great white sharks a legally protected species[160] (however, the kwazulu-natal sharks board is allowed to kill great white sharks in its ""shark control"" program in eastern south africa).[150] intending to ban the practice of shark finning while at sea, the united states congress passed the shark finning prohibition act in 2000.[161] two years later the act saw its first legal challenge in united states v. approximately 64,695 pounds of shark fins. in 2008 a federal appeals court ruled that a loophole in the law allowed non-fishing vessels to purchase shark fins from fishing vessels while on the high seas.[162] seeking to close the loophole, the shark conservation act was passed by congress in december 2010, and it was signed into law in january 2011.[163][164] in 2003, the european union introduced a general shark finning ban for all vessels of all nationalities in union waters and for all vessels flying a flag of one of its member states.[165] this prohibition was amended in june 2013 to close remaining loopholes.[166] in 2009, the international union for conservation of nature's iucn red list of endangered species named 64 species, one-third of all oceanic shark species, as being at risk of extinction due to fishing and shark finning.[167][168] in 2010, the convention on international trade in endangered species (cites) rejected proposals from the united states and palau that would have required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of scalloped hammerhead, oceanic whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks. the majority, but not the required two-thirds of voting delegates, approved the proposal. china, by far the world's largest shark market, and japan, which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species, led the opposition.[169][170] in march 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to appendix 2 of cites, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.[171] in 2010, greenpeace international added the school shark, shortfin mako shark, mackerel shark, tiger shark and spiny dogfish to its seafood red list, a list of common supermarket fish that are often sourced from unsustainable fisheries.[172] advocacy group shark trust campaigns to limit shark fishing. advocacy group seafood watch directs american consumers to not eat sharks.[173] under the auspices of the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals (cms), also known as the bonn convention, the memorandum of understanding on the conservation of migratory sharks was concluded and came into effect in march 2010. it was the first global instrument concluded under cms and aims at facilitating international coordination for the protection, conservation and management of migratory sharks, through multilateral, intergovernmental discussion and scientific research. in july 2013, new york state, a major market and entry point for shark fins, banned the shark fin trade joining seven other states of the united states and the three pacific u.s territories in providing legal protection to sharks.[174] in the united states, and as of january 16, 2019, 12 states including (massachusetts, maryland, delaware, california, illinois, hawaii, oregon, nevada, rhode island, washington, new york and texas) along with 3 u.s. territories (american samoa, guam and the northern mariana islands) have passed laws against the sale or possession of shark fins.[175][176] several regions now have shark sanctuaries or have banned shark fishing — these regions include american samoa, the bahamas, the cook islands, french polynesia, guam, the maldives, the marshall islands, micronesia, the northern mariana islands, and palau.[177][178] in april 2020 researchers reported to have traced the origins of shark fins of endangered hammerhead sharks from a retail market in hong kong back to their source populations and therefore the approximate locations where the sharks were first caught using dna analysis.[179][180] in july 2020 scientists reported results of a survey of 371 reefs in 58 nations estimating the conservation status of reef sharks globally. no sharks have been observed on almost 20% of the surveyed reefs and shark depletion was strongly associated with both socio-economic conditions and conservation measures.[181][182] sharks are considered to be a vital part of the ocean ecosystem. "
sheep," ovis guineensis linnaeus, 1758 ovis strepsiceros linnaeus, 1758 sheep (ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. like most ruminants, sheep are members of the order artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. although the name sheep applies to many species in the genus ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to ovis aries. numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. an adult female is referred to as a ewe (/juː/), an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep as a lamb. sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of europe and asia, with iran being a geographic envelope of the domestication center.[1] one of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleeces, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. a sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones in commonwealth countries, and lamb in the united states (including from adults). sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science. sheep husbandry is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. in the modern era, australia, new zealand, the southern and central south american nations, and the british isles are most closely associated with sheep production. there is a large lexicon of unique terms for sheep husbandry which vary considerably by region and dialect. use of the word sheep began in middle english as a derivation of the old english word scēap; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. a group of sheep is called a flock. many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age. being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and symbology. as livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, arcadian imagery. sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the golden fleece—and major religions, especially the abrahamic traditions. in both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals. the exact line of descent between domestic sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear.[2] the most common hypothesis states that ovis aries is descended from the asiatic (o. orientalis) species of mouflon.[3] sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated by humankind (although the domestication of dogs may have taken place more than 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 b.c in mesopotamia[4][5][6][7] and possibly around 7,000 b.c. in mehrgarh in the indus valley.[8][9] the rearing of sheep for secondary products, and the resulting breed development, began in either southwest asia or western europe.[10] initially, sheep were kept solely for meat, milk and skins. archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites in iran suggests that selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000 bc,[3][11] and the earliest woven wool garments have been dated to two to three thousand years later.[12] sheep husbandry spread quickly in europe. excavations show that in about 6000 bc, during the neolithic period of prehistory, the castelnovien people, living around châteauneuf-les-martigues near present-day marseille in the south of france, were among the first in europe to keep domestic sheep.[13] practically from its inception, ancient greek civilization relied on sheep as primary livestock, and were even said to name individual animals.[14] ancient romans kept sheep on a wide scale, and were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising. pliny the elder, in his natural history (naturalis historia), speaks at length about sheep and wool.[15] european colonists spread the practice to the new world from 1493 onwards.[16][17] domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic as a result of selective breeding by humans.[18][19] a few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.[16] another trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color. wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald.[20][21] selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly. however, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks.[20][21] while white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning.[22] the nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike. there is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so wool classing is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre. depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights. their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding.[23] ewes typically weigh between 45 and 100 kilograms (100 and 220 lb), and rams between 45 and 160 kilograms (100 and 350 lb).[24] when all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth.[25] mature sheep have 32 teeth. as with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw. these are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed. there are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped canines. this means that the dental formula for sheep is either 0.0.3.34.0.3.3 or 0.0.3.33.1.3.3 [26] there is a large diastema between the incisors and the molars. in the first few years of life one can calculate the age of sheep from their front teeth, as a pair of milk teeth is replaced by larger adult teeth each year, the full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age. the front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age, making it harder for them to feed and hindering the health and productivity of the animal. for this reason, domestic sheep on normal pasture begin to slowly decline from four years on, and the life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, though some sheep may live as long as 20 years.[16][27][28] sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled.[29] sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, with excellent peripheral vision; with visual fields of about 270° to 320°, sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads.[22][30] many breeds have only short hair on the face, and some have facial wool (if any) confined to the poll and or the area of the mandibular angle; the wide angles of peripheral vision apply to these breeds. a few breeds tend to have considerable wool on the face; for some individuals of these breeds, peripheral vision may be greatly reduced by ""wool blindness"", unless recently shorn about the face.[31] sheep have poor depth perception; shadows and dips in the ground may cause sheep to baulk. in general, sheep have a tendency to move out of the dark and into well-lit areas,[32] and prefer to move uphill when disturbed. sheep also have an excellent sense of smell, and, like all species of their genus, have scent glands just in front of the eyes, and interdigitally on the feet. the purpose of these glands is uncertain,[33] but those on the face may be used in breeding behaviors.[23] the foot glands might also be related to reproduction,[23] but alternative functions, such as secretion of a waste product or a scent marker to help lost sheep find their flock, have also been proposed.[33] sheep and goats are closely related: both are in the subfamily caprinae. however, they are separate species, so hybrids rarely occur, and are always infertile. a hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a sheep-goat hybrid, and is not to be confused with the sheep-goat chimera, though both are known as geep. visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. sheep tails also hang down, even when short or docked, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. also, sheep breeds are often naturally polled (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the rut, whereas rams do not.[28] the domestic sheep is a multi-purpose animal, and the more than 200 breeds now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes.[16][34] some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds,[35][36] but these numbers cannot be verified, according to some sources.[22][28] however, several hundred breeds of sheep have been identified by the food and agriculture organization of the un (fao), with the estimated number varying somewhat from time to time: e.g. 863 breeds as of 1993,[37] 1314 breeds as of 1995[38] and 1229 breeds as of 2006.[39] (these numbers exclude extinct breeds, which are also tallied by the fao.) for the purpose of such tallies, the fao definition of a breed is ""either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity.""[39] almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed. other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the topography for which the breed has been developed. this last point is especially stressed in the uk, where breeds are described as either upland (hill or mountain) or lowland breeds.[32] a sheep may also be of a fat-tailed type, which is a dual-purpose sheep common in africa and asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail. breeds are often categorized by the type of their wool. fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. most of these were derived from merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces.[40] some major medium wool breeds, such as the corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. for example: the american columbia breed was developed by crossing lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled rambouillet ewes. coarse or carpet wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness. breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). as the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.[41] a minor class of sheep are the dairy breeds. dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. these sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves.[42] in the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.[43] a last group of sheep breeds is that of fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. hair sheep are similar to the early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. for meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing.[41] hair sheep are also more resistant to parasites and hot weather.[28] with the modern rise of corporate agribusiness and the decline of localized family farms, many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction. the rare breeds survival trust of the uk lists 22 native breeds as having only 3,000 registered animals (each), and the livestock conservancy lists 14 as either ""critical"" or ""threatened"".[44][45][46] preferences for breeds with uniform characteristics and fast growth have pushed heritage (or heirloom) breeds to the margins of the sheep industry.[41] those that remain are maintained through the efforts of conservation organizations, breed registries, and individual farmers dedicated to their preservation. sheep are herbivorous mammals. most breeds prefer to graze on grass and other short roughage, avoiding the taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume.[47] both sheep and goats use their lips and tongues to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition.[47] sheep, however, graze well in monoculture pastures where most goats fare poorly.[47] like all ruminants, sheep have a complex digestive system composed of four chambers, allowing them to break down cellulose from stems, leaves, and seed hulls into simpler carbohydrates. when sheep graze, vegetation is chewed into a mass called a bolus, which is then passed into the rumen, via the reticulum. the rumen is a 19- to 38-liter (5 to 10 gallon) organ in which feed is fermented.[48] the fermenting organisms include bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.[49] (other important rumen organisms include some archaea, which produce methane from carbon dioxide.[50]) the bolus is periodically regurgitated back to the mouth as cud for additional chewing and salivation.[48] after fermentation in the rumen, feed passes into the reticulum and the omasum; special feeds such as grains may bypass the rumen altogether. after the first three chambers, food moves into the abomasum for final digestion before processing by the intestines. the abomasum is the only one of the four chambers analogous to the human stomach, and is sometimes called the ""true stomach"".[51] other than forage, the other staple feed for sheep is hay, often during the winter months. the ability to thrive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep can survive on this diet.[41] also included in some sheep's diets are minerals, either in a trace mix or in licks. feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of copper that are lethal to sheep.[22] the same danger applies to mineral supplements such as salt licks.[52] sheep follow a diurnal pattern of activity, feeding from dawn to dusk, stopping sporadically to rest and chew their cud. ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs.[53] types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and rhododendron.[54] sheep are largely grazing herbivores, unlike browsing animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. with a much narrower face, sheep crop plants very close to the ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle.[28] for this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover.[28][32] paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. by disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. however, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing.[55] research conducted in imperial county, california compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. in this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.[56] sheep are flock animals and strongly gregarious; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies. the dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species.[57] furthermore, in contrast to the red deer and gazelle (two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times), sheep do not defend territories although they do form home ranges.[58] all sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock, although this behavior varies with breed,[29] and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members.[23] during flocking, sheep have a strong tendency to follow, and a leader may simply be the first individual to move. relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep: in mixed-breed flocks, subgroups of the same breed tend to form, and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks.[22] sheep can become hefted to one particular local pasture (heft) so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes. lambs learn the heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals.[23][59] flock behaviour in sheep is generally only exhibited in groups of four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep.[22] being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. this is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.[22] in regions where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior.[28] farmers exploit flocking behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, and to move them more easily. for this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability. sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food.[60] those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.[61][62] sheep establish a dominance hierarchy through fighting, threats and competitiveness. dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep, and usually feed first at troughs.[63] primarily among rams, horn size is a factor in the flock hierarchy.[64] rams with different size horns may be less inclined to fight to establish the dominance order, while rams with similarly sized horns are more so.[64] merinos have an almost linear hierarchy whereas there is a less rigid structure in border leicesters when a competitive feeding situation arises.[65] in sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definitive study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.[65] sheep are frequently thought of as unintelligent animals.[66] their flocking behavior and quickness to flee and panic can make shepherding a difficult endeavor for the uninitiated. despite these perceptions, a university of illinois monograph on sheep reported their intelligence to be just below that of pigs and on par with that of cattle.[22] sheep can recognize individual human and ovine faces and remember them for years.[67][68] in addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics.[67][68] if worked with patiently, sheep may learn their names, and many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes.[22] sheep have also responded well to clicker training.[22] sheep have been used as pack animals; tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.[22] it has been reported that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in west yorkshire, england allegedly found a way to get over cattle grids by rolling on their backs, although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.[69] sounds made by domestic sheep include bleats, grunts, rumbles and snorts. bleating (""baaing"") is used mostly for contact communication, especially between dam and lambs, but also at times between other flock members.[70] the bleats of individual sheep are distinctive, enabling the ewe and her lambs to recognize each other's vocalizations.[71] vocal communication between lambs and their dam declines to a very low level within several weeks after parturition.[70] a variety of bleats may be heard, depending on sheep age and circumstances. apart from contact communication, bleating may signal distress, frustration or impatience; however, sheep are usually silent when in pain. isolation commonly prompts bleating by sheep.[72] pregnant ewes may grunt when in labor.[73] rumbling sounds are made by the ram during courting; somewhat similar rumbling sounds may be made by the ewe,[70] especially when with her neonate lambs. a snort (explosive exhalation through the nostrils) may signal aggression or a warning,[70][74] and is often elicited from startled sheep.[75] in sheep breeds lacking facial wool, the visual field is wide. in 10 sheep (cambridge, lleyn and welsh mountain breeds, which lack facial wool), the visual field ranged from 298° to 325°, averaging 313.1°, with binocular overlap ranging from 44.5° to 74°, averaging 61.7°.[76] in some breeds, unshorn facial wool can limit the visual field; in some individuals, this may be enough to cause ""wool blindness"". in 60 merinos, visual fields ranged from 219.1° to 303.0°, averaging 269.9°, and the binocular field ranged from 8.9° to 77.7°, averaging 47.5°; 36% of the measurements were limited by wool,[77] although photographs of the experiments indicate that only limited facial wool regrowth had occurred since shearing. in addition to facial wool (in some breeds), visual field limitations can include ears and (in some breeds) horns,[77] so the visual field can be extended by tilting the head. sheep eyes exhibit very low hyperopia and little astigmatism. such visual characteristics are likely to produce a well-focused retinal image of objects in both the middle and long distance.[76] because sheep eyes have no accommodation, one might expect the image of very near objects to be blurred, but a rather clear near image could be provided by the tapetum and large retinal image of the sheep's eye, and adequate close vision may occur at muzzle length.[76] good depth perception, inferred from the sheep's sure-footedness, was confirmed in ""visual cliff"" experiments;[77][78] behavioral responses indicating depth perception are seen in lambs at one day old.[79] sheep are thought to have colour vision, and can distinguish between a variety of colours: black, red, brown, green, yellow and white.[80] sight is a vital part of sheep communication, and when grazing, they maintain visual contact with each other.[81] each sheep lifts its head upwards to check the position of other sheep in the flock. this constant monitoring is probably what keeps the sheep in a flock as they move along grazing. sheep become stressed when isolated; this stress is reduced if they are provided with a mirror, indicating that the sight of other sheep reduces stress.[82] taste is the most important sense in sheep, establishing forage preferences, with sweet and sour plants being preferred and bitter plants being more commonly rejected. touch and sight are also important in relation to specific plant characteristics, such as succulence and growth form.[83] the ram uses his vomeronasal organ (sometimes called the jacobson's organ) to sense the pheromones of ewes and detect when they are in estrus.[84] the ewe uses her vomeronasal organ for early recognition of her neonate lamb.[85] sheep follow a similar reproductive strategy to other herd animals. a group of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams.[41] most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round.[41] ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months.[41] however, there are exceptions. for example, finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months.[86] ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days,[87] during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. a minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality[88] and a small number of the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).[89][90][91][92] in feral sheep, rams may fight during the rut to determine which individuals may mate with ewes. rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely.[41] during the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.[23] after mating, sheep have a gestation period of about five months,[93] and normal labor takes one to three hours.[94] although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs.[23][95] during or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs,[96] small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.[32][41] ovine obstetrics can be problematic. by selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding.[97] in the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs.[41] after the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb.[41] most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth.[41] in normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.[98] most lambs begin life being born outdoors. after lambs are several weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, mulesing, and castrating) is carried out.[41] vaccinations are usually carried out at this point as well. ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later identification of sheep. docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications.[99][100] the first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum is expected to have fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity.[101][102][103] ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing.[104] ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated.[32] objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they save money, and inflict only temporary pain.[23][41] sheep may fall victim to poisons, infectious diseases, and physical injuries. as a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators.[23] however, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless.[105] throughout history, much of the money and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments. historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. in some developed countries, including the united states, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use.[106] however, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions. in the us, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 cfr (code of federal regulations) part 530.[107] in the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as homeopathy, herbalism and even traditional chinese medicine to treat sheep veterinary problems.[22][23] despite some favorable anecdotal evidence, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in scientific journals.[22][23][108] the need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and antibiotics is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified organic farming with sheep.[41] many breeders take a variety of preventive measures to ward off problems. the first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased. many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior.[23] this can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month. two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep. restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems.[109][110][111][112] excessive stress can compromise the immune system.[112] ""shipping fever"" (pneumonic mannheimiosis, formerly called pasteurellosis) is a disease of particular concern, that can occur as a result of stress, notably during transport and (or) handling.[113][114] pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline). considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria.[110] because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management. avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are pesticide sprays, inorganic fertilizer, motor oil, as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.[115] common forms of preventive medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites. both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks.[23] worms are the most common internal parasites. they are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites.[32] external sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep keds, nose bots, sheep itch mites, and maggots. keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly, commonly lucilia sericata or its relative l. cuprina. fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike. flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. in addition to other treatments, crutching (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. some countries allow mulesing, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb.[116][117] nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. external parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.[23] a wide array of bacterial and viral diseases affect sheep. diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. foot rot is present in over 97% of flocks in the uk.[118] these painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. ovine johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats. sheep may also be affected by primary [119] or secondary photosensitization. tetanus can also afflict sheep through wounds from shearing, docking, castration, or vaccination. the organism also can be introduced into the reproductive tract by unsanitary humans who assist ewes during lambing.[120] a few sheep conditions are transmissible to humans. orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores can be transmitted in unwashed wool. more seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease (fmd), as both can devastate flocks. the latter poses a slight risk to humans. during the 2001 fmd pandemic in the uk, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare british breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.[23] of the 600,300 sheep lost to the us economy in 2004, 37.3% were lost to predators, while 26.5% were lost to some form of disease. poisoning accounted for 1.7% of non-productive deaths.[121] other than parasites and disease, predation is a threat to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic.[23] however, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. in africa, australia, the americas, and parts of europe and asia predators are a serious problem. in the united states, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation.[121] in contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry.[23] worldwide, canids—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths.[122][123][124] other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and feral hogs.[121][125] sheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to combat predation. pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used.[41] more modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators,[126] causing significant decreases in predator populations. in the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.[127] the 1970s saw a resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal.[32] donkeys and guard llamas have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs.[23] interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep.[41] in addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.[23] sheep are an important part of the global agricultural economy. however, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow.[32] china, australia, india, and iran have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton.[128] other countries such as new zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products. sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or sustainable agriculture and local food customers.[22][129] especially in developing countries, such flocks may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade. sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.[22] domestic sheep provide a wide array of raw materials. wool was one of the first textiles, although in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics.[22] for many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies.[22] fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation.[130] in the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.[32] sheepskin is likewise used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. byproducts from the slaughter of sheep are also of value: sheep tallow can be used in candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin.[131] sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets.[16] sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper.[132] of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.[16] some farmers who keep sheep also make a profit from live sheep. providing lambs for youth programs such as 4-h and competition at agricultural shows is often a dependable avenue for the sale of sheep.[133] farmers may also choose to focus on a particular breed of sheep in order to sell registered purebred animals, as well as provide a ram rental service for breeding.[134] a new option for deriving profit from live sheep is the rental of flocks for grazing; these ""mowing services"" are hired in order to keep unwanted vegetation down in public spaces and to lessen fire hazard.[135] despite the falling demand and price for sheep products in many markets, sheep have distinct economic advantages when compared with other livestock. they do not require expensive housing,[136] such as that used in the intensive farming of chickens or pigs. they are an efficient use of land; roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse.[23][137] sheep can also consume plants, such as noxious weeds, that most other animals will not touch, and produce more young at a faster rate.[138] also, in contrast to most livestock species, the cost of raising sheep is not necessarily tied to the price of feed crops such as grain, soybeans and corn.[139] combined with the lower cost of quality sheep, all these factors combine to equal a lower overhead for sheep producers, thus entailing a higher profitability potential for the small farmer.[139] sheep are especially beneficial for independent producers, including family farms with limited resources, as the sheep industry is one of the few types of animal agriculture that has not been vertically integrated by agribusiness.[140] however, small flocks, from 10 to 50 ewes, often are not profitable because they tend to be poorly managed. the primary reason is that mechanization is not feasible, so return per hour of labor is not maximized. small farm flocks generally are used simply to control weeds on irrigation ditches or maintained as a hobby.[141] sheep meat and milk were one of the earliest staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.[23] sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb, and approximately 540 million sheep are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.[142] ""mutton"" is derived from the old french moton, which was the word for sheep used by the anglo-norman rulers of much of the british isles in the middle ages. this became the name for sheep meat in english, while the old english word sceap was kept for the live animal.[143] throughout modern history, ""mutton"" has been limited to the meat of mature sheep usually at least two years of age; ""lamb"" is used for that of immature sheep less than a year.[144][145][146] in the 21st century, the nations with the highest consumption of sheep meat are the arab states of the persian gulf, new zealand, australia, greece, uruguay, the united kingdom and ireland.[22] these countries eat 14–40 lbs (3–18 kg) of sheep meat per capita, per annum.[22][146] sheep meat is also popular in france, africa (especially the arab world), the caribbean, the rest of the middle east, india, and parts of china.[146] this often reflects a history of sheep production. in these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and offal may be popular or traditional. sheep testicles—called animelles or lamb fries—are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world. perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the scottish haggis, composed of various sheep innards cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach.[147] in comparison, countries such as the u.s. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5 kg), with americans eating 50 pounds (22 kg) of pork and 65 pounds (29 kg) of beef.[146] in addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly lamb chops and leg of lamb.[22] though sheep's milk may be drunk rarely in fresh form,[148] today it is used predominantly in cheese and yogurt making. sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows.[23] however, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process.[43] it also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content.[43] well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the feta of bulgaria and greece, roquefort of france, manchego from spain, the pecorino romano (the italian word for sheep is pecore) and ricotta of italy. yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk.[149] many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin.[22] sheep milk contains 4.8% lactose, which may affect those who are intolerant.[22] as with other domestic animals, the meat of uncastrated males is inferior in quality, especially as they grow. a ""bucky"" lamb is a lamb which was not castrated early enough, or which was castrated improperly (resulting in one testicle being retained). these lambs are worth less at market.[150][151][152] sheep are generally too large and reproduce too slowly to make ideal research subjects, and thus are not a common model organism.[153] they have, however, played an influential role in some fields of science. in particular, the roslin institute of edinburgh, scotland used sheep for genetics research that produced groundbreaking results. in 1995, two ewes named megan and morag were the first mammals cloned from differentiated cells. a year later, a finnish dorset sheep named dolly, dubbed ""the world's most famous sheep"" in scientific american,[154] was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell. following this, polly and molly were the first mammals to be simultaneously cloned and transgenic. as of 2008, the sheep genome has not been fully sequenced, although a detailed genetic map has been published,[155] and a draft version of the complete genome produced by assembling sheep dna sequences using information given by the genomes of other mammals.[156] in 2012, a transgenic sheep named ""peng peng"" was cloned by chinese scientists, who spliced his genes with that of a roundworm (c. elegans) in order to increase production of fats healthier for human consumption.[157] in the study of natural selection, the population of soay sheep that remain on the island of hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success.[158] soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively.[159] the feral soays on hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.[160] sheep are one of the few animals where the molecular basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined.[161] however, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the oregon health and science university that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams. organizations such as peta campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep.[88] ohsu and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.[88] domestic sheep are sometimes used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, in areas such as hypertension and heart failure.[162][163] pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy,[164] and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia.[165] in behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.[166] sheep have had a strong presence in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock. in the english language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led.[167] in contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the los angeles rams football team and the dodge ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, ovis canadensis. counting sheep is popularly said to be an aid to sleep, and some ancient systems of counting sheep persist today. sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and idiom frequently with such phrases as ""black sheep"". to call an individual a black sheep implies that they are an odd or disreputable member of a group.[168] this usage derives from the recessive trait that causes an occasional black lamb to be born into an entirely white flock. these black sheep were considered undesirable by shepherds, as black wool is not as commercially viable as white wool.[168] citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the portmanteau neologism of sheeple. somewhat differently, the adjective ""sheepish"" is also used to describe embarrassment.[169] in british heraldry, sheep appear in the form of rams, sheep proper and lambs. these are distinguished by the ram being depicted with horns and a tail, the sheep with neither and the lamb with its tail only. a further variant of the lamb, termed the paschal lamb, is depicted as carrying a christian cross and with a halo over its head. rams' heads, portrayed without a neck and facing the viewer, are also found in british armories. the fleece, depicted as an entire sheepskin carried by a ring around its midsection, originally became known through its use in the arms of the order of the golden fleece and was later adopted by towns and individuals with connections to the wool industry.[170] in antiquity, symbolism involving sheep cropped up in religions in the ancient near east, the mideast, and the mediterranean area: çatalhöyük, ancient egyptian religion, the cana'anite and phoenician tradition, judaism, greek religion, and others. religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began with some of the first known faiths: skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the çatalhöyük settlement in 8,000 bce.[171] in ancient egyptian religion, the ram was the symbol of several gods: khnum, heryshaf and amun (in his incarnation as a god of fertility).[22] other deities occasionally shown with ram features include the goddess ishtar, the phoenician god baal-hamon, and the babylonian god ea-oannes.[22] in madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.[172] there are many ancient greek references to sheep: that of chrysomallos, the golden-fleeced ram, continuing to be told through into the modern era. astrologically, aries, the ram, is the first sign of the classical greek zodiac, and the sheep is the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the chinese zodiac, related to the chinese calendar.[172] in mongolia, shagai are an ancient form of dice made from the cuboid bones of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes. sheep play an important role in all the abrahamic faiths; abraham, isaac, jacob, moses, king david and the islamic prophet muhammad were all shepherds. according to the biblical story of the binding of isaac, a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for isaac after an angel stays abraham's hand (in the islamic tradition, abraham was about to sacrifice ishmael). eid al-adha is a major annual festival in islam in which sheep (or other animals) are sacrificed in remembrance of this act.[173][174] sheep are occasionally sacrificed to commemorate important secular events in islamic cultures.[175] greeks and romans sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and judaism once sacrificed sheep as a korban (sacrifice), such as the passover lamb .[172] ovine symbols—such as the ceremonial blowing of a shofar—still find a presence in modern judaic traditions. collectively, followers of christianity are often referred to as a flock, with christ as the good shepherd, and sheep are an element in the christian iconography of the birth of jesus. some christian saints are considered patrons of shepherds, and even of sheep themselves. christ is also portrayed as the sacrificial lamb of god (agnus dei) and easter celebrations in greece and romania traditionally feature a meal of paschal lamb. a church leader is often called the pastor, which is derived from the latin word for shepherd. in many western christian traditions bishops carry a staff, which also serves as a symbol of the episcopal office, known as a crosier, which is modeled on the shepherd's crook. sheep are key symbols in fables and nursery rhymes like the wolf in sheep's clothing, little bo peep, baa, baa, black sheep, and mary had a little lamb; novels such as george orwell's animal farm and haruki murakami's a wild sheep chase; songs such as bach's sheep may safely graze (schafe können sicher weiden) and pink floyd's sheep, and poems like william blake's ""the lamb"". "
whale," whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. they are an informal grouping within the infraorder cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. the two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (mysticeti) and toothed whales (odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. whales consist of eight extant families: balaenopteridae (the rorquals), balaenidae (right whales), cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), physeteridae (the sperm whale), kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and ziphiidae (the beaked whales). whales are fully aquatic, open ocean creatures, and feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. whales range in size from the 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) and 135 kilograms (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 29.9 metres (98 ft) and 190 metric tons (210 short tons) blue whale, which is the largest known creature that has ever lived. the sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. they use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth adapted to catching fish or squid. baleen whales have a well developed sense of ""smell"", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. some species, such as sperm whales, are well adapted for diving to great depths to catch squid and other favoured prey. whales evolved from land-living mammals. as such, whales must breathe air regularly, although they can remain submerged under water for long periods of time. some species such as the sperm whale are able to stay submerged for as much as 90 minutes.[1] they have blowholes (modified nostrils) located on top of their heads, through which air is taken in and expelled. they are warm-blooded, and have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin. with streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers, whales can travel at up to 20 knots, though they are not as flexible or agile as seals. whales produce a great variety of vocalizations, notably the extended songs of the humpback whale. although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the northern and southern hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding. males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years. once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. the north atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and the north pacific grey whale population is ranked critically endangered by the iucn. besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. the meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the arctic. whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the inuit and the coastal peoples of vietnam and ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals. whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of herman melville's moby dick. small whales, such as belugas, are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture. whale watching has become a form of tourism around the world. the word ""whale"" comes from the old english hwæl, from proto-germanic *hwalaz, from proto indo european *(s)kwal-o-, meaning ""large sea fish"".[2][3] the proto-germanic *hwalaz is also the source of old saxon hwal, old norse hvalr, hvalfiskr, swedish val, middle dutch wal, walvisc, dutch walvis, old high german wal, and german wal.[2] the obsolete ""whalefish"" has a similar derivation, indicating a time when whales were thought to be fish.[citation needed] other archaic english forms include wal, wale, whal, whalle, whaille, wheal, etc.[4] the term ""whale"" is sometimes used interchangeably with dolphins and porpoises, acting as a synonym for cetacea. six species of dolphins have the word ""whale"" in their name, collectively known as blackfish: the orca, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy orca, the false orca, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).[5] each species has a different reason for it, for example, the orca was named ""ballena asesina"" 'orca' by spanish sailors.[6] the term ""great whales"" covers those currently regulated by the international whaling commission:[7] the odontoceti family physeteridae (sperm whales); and the mysticeti families balaenidae (right and bowhead whales), eschrichtiidae (grey whales), and some of the balaenopteridae (minke, bryde's, sei, blue and fin; not eden's and omura's whales).[8] the whales are part of the largely terrestrial mammalian clade laurasiatheria. whales do not form a clade or order; the infraorder cetacea includes dolphins and porpoises, which are not considered whales.[citation needed] the phylogenetic tree shows the relationships of whales and other mammals, with whale groups[citation needed] marked in green. (carnivorans and allies) (horses, rhinos, tapirs) (camelids) pigs ruminants (cattle, sheep, antelopes) hippopotamuses archaeocetes (ambulocetus, protocetus, basilosaurus) (right, grey, rorquals) delphinoidea (dolphins, porpoises, beluga whales, narwhals) lipotoidea (river dolphins) physeteroidea (sperm whales) ziphoidea (beaked whales) cetaceans are divided into two parvorders: the largest parvorder, mysticeti (baleen whales), is characterized by the presence of baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which it uses to filter plankton, among others, from the water; odontocetes (toothed whales) are characterized by bearing sharp teeth for hunting, as opposed to their counterparts' baleen.[9] cetaceans and artiodactyls now are classified under the order cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as artiodactyla, which includes both whales and hippopotamuses. the hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are the whale's closest terrestrial living relatives.[10] mysticetes are also known as baleen whales. they have a pair of blowholes side by side and lack teeth; instead they have baleen plates which form a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which they use to filter plankton from the water. some whales, such as the humpback, reside in the polar regions where they feed on a reliable source of schooling fish and krill.[11] these animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but do not form a rigid rib cage. this adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as the pressure increases.[12] mysticetes consist of four families: rorquals (balaenopterids), cetotheriids, right whales (balaenids), and grey whales (eschrichtiids). the main difference between each family of mysticete is in their feeding adaptations and subsequent behaviour. balaenopterids are the rorquals. these animals, along with the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. the throat pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more efficient capture of the small animals they feed on. balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.[13] balaenids are the right whales. these animals have very large heads, which can make up as much as 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. this allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.[14] eschrichtiids have one living member: the grey whale. they are bottom feeders, mainly eating crustaceans and benthic invertebrates. they feed by turning on their sides and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. this is an efficient method of hunting, in which the whale has no major competitors.[15] odontocetes are known as toothed whales; they have teeth and only one blowhole. they rely on their well-developed sonar to find their way in the water. toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using the melon. sound waves travel through the water. upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. these vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted.[16] all toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. these animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. this adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure.[12] excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: belugas and narwhals (monodontids), sperm whales (physeterids), dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids), and beaked whales (ziphiids). there are six species, sometimes referred to as ""blackfish"", that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the orca, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy orca, the false orca, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).[5] the differences between families of odontocetes include size, feeding adaptations and distribution. monodontids consist of two species: the beluga and the narwhal. they both reside in the frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their coloration acting as camouflage. narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. they have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.[17] physeterids and kogiids consist of sperm whales. sperm whales consist the largest and smallest odontocetes, and spend a large portion of their life hunting squid. p. macrocephalus spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require any degree of light at all, in fact, blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health. the behaviour of kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the photic zone.[18] ziphiids consist of 22 species of beaked whale. these vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, but they all share a similar hunting style. they use a suction technique, aided by a pair of grooves on the underside of their head, not unlike the throat pleats on the rorquals, to feed.[19] whales are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). they are related to the indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.[20][21] primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. what defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth.[22][23][24][10] their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (ambulocetus 49 mya), a streamlined body and the growth of flukes on the tail (protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils toward the top of the cranium (blowholes), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (basilosaurus 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).[25][26][27] whale morphology shows a number of examples of convergent evolution, the most obvious being the streamlined fish-like body shape.[28] other examples include the use of echolocation for hunting in low light conditions — which is the same hearing adaptation used by bats — and, in the rorqual whales, jaw adaptations, similar to those found in pelicans, that enable engulfment feeding.[29] today, the closest living relatives of cetaceans are the hippopotamuses; these share a semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 mya.[10] around 40 mya, a common ancestor between the two branched off into cetacea and anthracotheres; nearly all anthracotheres became extinct at the end of the pleistocene 2.5 mya, eventually leaving only one surviving lineage – the hippopotamus.[30] whales split into two separate parvorders around 34 mya – the baleen whales (mysticetes) and the toothed whales (odontocetes).[31][32][33] whales have torpedo shaped bodies with non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, non-existent external ear flaps, a large tail fin, and flat heads (with the exception of monodontids and ziphiids). whale skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts (with the exception of monodontids and ziphiids) and eyes placed on the sides of its head. whales range in size from the 2.6-metre (8.5 ft) and 135-kilogram (298 lb) dwarf sperm whale to the 34-metre (112 ft) and 190-metric-ton (210-short-ton) blue whale. overall, they tend to dwarf other cetartiodactyls; the blue whale is the largest creature on earth. several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males. one exception is with the sperm whale, which has males larger than the females.[34][35] odontocetes, such as the sperm whale, possess teeth with cementum cells overlying dentine cells. unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. mysticetes have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas odontocetes contain only one.[36] breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs; a humpback whale's lungs can hold about 5,000 litres of air. spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification.[37][38] all whales have a thick layer of blubber. in species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. this blubber can help with buoyancy (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. it can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.[39][40] whales have a two- to three-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. mysticetes contain a proventriculus as an extension of the oesophagus; this contains stones that grind up food. they also have fundic and pyloric chambers.[41] whales have two flippers on the front, and a tail fin. these flippers contain four digits. although whales do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some, such as the sperm whale and bowhead whale, possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. whales are fast swimmers in comparison to seals, which typically cruise at 5–15 kn, or 9–28 kilometres per hour (5.6–17.4 mph); the fin whale, in comparison, can travel at speeds up to 47 kilometres per hour (29 mph) and the sperm whale can reach speeds of 35 kilometres per hour (22 mph). the fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility; whales are unable to turn their heads. when swimming, whales rely on their tail fin to propel them through the water. flipper movement is continuous. whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. some species log out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. most species have a dorsal fin.[42][43] whales are adapted for diving to great depths. in addition to their streamlined bodies, they can slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen; blood is rerouted from tissue tolerant of water pressure to the heart and brain among other organs; haemoglobin and myoglobin store oxygen in body tissue; and they have twice the concentration of myoglobin than haemoglobin. before going on long dives, many whales exhibit a behaviour known as sounding; they stay close to the surface for a series of short, shallow dives while building their oxygen reserves, and then make a sounding dive.[12][44] the whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. in humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. in whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear.[45] the whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater.[46] odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. this melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. the melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. a beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.[47][48][49][50] the whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. as well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. when belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals.[51] most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. they also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.[52][53] the olfactory lobes are absent in toothed whales, suggesting that they have no sense of smell. some whales, such as the bowhead whale, possess a vomeronasal organ, which does mean that they can ""sniff out"" krill.[54] whales are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. however, some toothed whales have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste. the presence of the jacobson's organ indicates that whales can smell food once inside their mouth, which might be similar to the sensation of taste.[55] whale vocalization is likely to serve several purposes. some species, such as the humpback whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. these sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. humpback whales only have been heard making clicks, while toothed whales use sonar that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73 dbm or +43 dbw)[56] and be heard for many miles. captive whales have occasionally been known to mimic human speech. scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire on behalf of the whales to communicate with humans, as whales have a very different vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort.[57] whales emit two distinct kinds of acoustic signals, which are called whistles and clicks:[58] clicks are quick broadband burst pulses, used for sonar, although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the pulsed calls of belugas. pulses in a click train are emitted at intervals of ≈35–50 milliseconds, and in general these inter-click intervals are slightly greater than the round-trip time of sound to the target. whistles are narrow-band frequency modulated (fm) signals, used for communicative purposes, such as contact calls. whales are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve.[59] the neocortex of many species of whale is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids.[60] in humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgement, and theory of mind. whale spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.[61] brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass. comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalisation quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. sperm whales have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging 8,000 cubic centimetres (490 in3) and 7.8 kilograms (17 lb) in mature males, in comparison to the average human brain which averages 1,450 cubic centimetres (88 in3) in mature males.[62] the brain to body mass ratio in some odontocetes, such as belugas and narwhals, is second only to humans.[63] small whales are known to engage in complex play behaviour, which includes such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or ""bubble rings"". there are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. they also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface.[64] some believe this is a means of communication.[65] whales are also known to produce bubble-nets for the purpose of foraging.[66] larger whales are also thought, to some degree, to engage in play. the southern right whale, for example, elevates their tail fluke above the water, remaining in the same position for a considerable amount of time. this is known as ""sailing"". it appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off the coast of argentina and south africa. humpback whales, among others, are also known to display this behaviour.[67] whales are fully aquatic creatures, which means that birth and courtship behaviours are very different from terrestrial and semi-aquatic creatures. since they are unable to go onto land to calve, they deliver the baby with the fetus positioned for tail-first delivery. this prevents the baby from drowning either upon or during delivery. to feed the new-born, whales, being aquatic, must squirt the milk into the mouth of the calf. being mammals, they have mammary glands used for nursing calves; they are weaned off at about 11 months of age. this milk contains high amounts of fat which is meant to hasten the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste.[68] females deliver a single calf with gestation lasting about a year, dependency until one to two years, and maturity around seven to ten years, all varying between the species.[69] this mode of reproduction produces few offspring, but increases the survival probability of each one. females, referred to as ""cows"", carry the responsibility of childcare as males, referred to as ""bulls"", play no part in raising calves. most mysticetes reside at the poles. so, to prevent the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. they will then stay there for a matter of months until the calf has developed enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty milk.[70] with the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. most will travel from the arctic or antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. one exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to patagonia and western new zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.[71] unlike most animals, whales are conscious breathers. all mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. while knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, toothed cetaceans in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, so that they may swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.[72] a 2008 study found that sperm whales sleep in vertical postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales do not respond to passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.[72] all whales are carnivorous and predatory. odontocetes, as a whole, mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, and then followed by crustaceans and bivalves. all species are generalist and opportunistic feeders. mysticetes, as a whole, mostly feed on krill and plankton, followed by crustaceans and other invertebrates. a few are specialists. examples include the blue whale, which eats almost exclusively krill, the minke whale, which eats mainly schooling fish, the sperm whale, which specialize on squid, and the grey whale which feed on bottom-dwelling invertebrates.[13][73][74] the elaborate baleen ""teeth"" of filter-feeding species, mysticetes, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food by using the teeth as a sieve.[68] usually whales hunt solitarily, but they do sometimes hunt cooperatively in small groups. the former behaviour is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. when large amounts of prey are available, whales such as certain mysticetes hunt cooperatively in small groups.[75] some cetaceans may forage with other kinds of animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds.[76][77] large whales, such as mysticetes, are not usually subject to predation, but smaller whales, such as monodontids or ziphiids, are. these species are preyed on by the orca or orca. to subdue and kill whales, orcas continuously ram them with their heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely injure them. other times they corral the narwhals or belugas before striking. they are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer orcas, but they are seldom attacked by an individual. calves are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well.[78] these small whales are also targeted by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. the polar bear is well adapted for hunting arctic whales and calves. bears are known to use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. this however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. when out at sea, whales dive out of the reach of surface-hunting orcas. polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.[79] a 2010 study considered whales to be a positive influence to the productivity of ocean fisheries, in what has been termed a ""whale pump."" whales carry nutrients such as nitrogen from the depths back to the surface. this functions as an upward biological pump, reversing an earlier presumption that whales accelerate the loss of nutrients to the bottom. this nitrogen input in the gulf of maine is ""more than the input of all rivers combined"" emptying into the gulf, some 23,000 metric tons (25,000 short tons) each year.[81][82] whales defecate at the ocean's surface; their excrement is important for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen. the whale faeces are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where phytoplankton feed off it.[82][83][84] upon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots, such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents.[85] deterioration of whale carcasses happens though a series of three stages. initially, moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months, and as long as two years. this is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. this stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.[85][86] whaling by humans has existed since the stone age. ancient whalers used harpoons to spear the bigger animals from boats out at sea.[87] people from norway and japan started hunting whales around 2000 b.c.[88] whales are typically hunted for their meat and blubber by aboriginal groups; they used baleen for baskets or roofing, and made tools and masks out of bones.[88] the inuit hunted whales in the arctic ocean.[88] the basques started whaling as early as the 11th century, sailing as far as newfoundland in the 16th century in search of right whales.[89][90] 18th- and 19th-century whalers hunted whales mainly for their oil, which was used as lamp fuel and a lubricant, baleen or whalebone, which was used for items such as corsets and skirt hoops,[88] and ambergris, which was used as a fixative for perfumes. the most successful whaling nations at this time were the netherlands, japan, and the united states.[91] commercial whaling was historically important as an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. whaling was at that time a sizeable european industry with ships from britain, france, spain, denmark, the netherlands and germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war.[92] by the early 1790s, whalers, namely the americans and australians, focused efforts in the south pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and right whales, with catches of up to 39,000 right whales by americans alone.[89][93] by 1853, us profits reached us$11,000,000 (gb£6.5m), equivalent to us$348,000,000 (gb£230m) today, the most profitable year for the american whaling industry.[94] commonly exploited species included north atlantic right whales, sperm whales, which were mainly hunted by americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly hunted by the dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. the scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the international whaling commission (iwc) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.[95] current whaling nations are norway, iceland, and japan, despite their joining to the iwc, as well as the aboriginal communities of siberia, alaska, and northern canada.[96] subsistence hunters typically use whale products for themselves and depend on them for survival. national and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of hunting are seen as less destructive and wasteful. this distinction is being questioned as these aboriginal groups are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with, and are selling whale products in the marketplace. some anthropologists argue that the term ""subsistence"" should also apply to these cash-based exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption.[97][98][99] in 1946, the iwc placed a moratorium, limiting the annual whale catch. since then, yearly profits for these ""subsistence"" hunters have been close to us$31 million (gb£20m) per year.[95] whales can also be threatened by humans more indirectly. they are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. gillnetting and seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals.[100] species commonly entangled include beaked whales. whales are also affected by marine pollution. high levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain. they have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales as they are higher up the food chain than baleen whales. lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. these pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases.[101] they can also be poisoned by swallowing litter, such as plastic bags.[102] advanced military sonar harms whales. sonar interferes with the basic biological functions of whales—such as feeding and mating—by impacting their ability to echolocate. whales swim in response to sonar and sometimes experience decompression sickness due to rapid changes in depth. mass strandings have been triggered by sonar activity, resulting in injury or death.[103][104][105][106] whaling decreased substantially after 1946 when, in response to the steep decline in whale populations, the international whaling commission placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country; this excluded aboriginal groups up until 2004.[91][98][107][108] as of 2015, aboriginal communities are allowed to take 280 bowhead whales off alaska and two from the western coast of greenland, 620 grey whales off washington state, three common minke whales off the eastern coast of greenland and 178 on their western coast, 10 fin whales from the west coast of greenland, nine humpback whales from the west coast of greenland and 20 off st. vincent and the grenadines each year.[108] several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, grey whales may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting, but the north atlantic population is functionally extinct. conversely, the north atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched across the north atlantic, and only remains in small fragments along the coast of canada, greenland, and is considered functionally extinct along the european coastline.[109] the iwc has designated two whale sanctuaries: the southern ocean whale sanctuary, and the indian ocean whale sanctuary. the southern ocean whale sanctuary spans 30,560,860 square kilometres (11,799,610 sq mi) and envelopes antarctica.[110] the indian ocean whale sanctuary takes up all of the indian ocean south of 55°s.[111] the iwc is a voluntary organization, with no treaty. any nation may leave as they wish; the iwc cannot enforce any law it makes. as of 2013, the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) recognized 86 cetacean species, 40 of which are considered whales. as of 2018, six are considered at risk, as they are ranked ""endangered"" (blue whale, north atlantic right whale,[112] north pacific right whale, and sei whale), and ""vulnerable"" (fin whale[113] and sperm whale). twenty-one species have a ""data deficient"" ranking.[114] species that live in polar habitats are vulnerable to the effects of recent and ongoing climate change, particularly the time when pack ice forms and melts.[115] an estimated 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008, in all oceans except the arctic.[116] rules and codes of conduct have been created to minimize harassment of the whales.[117] iceland, japan and norway have both whaling and whale watching industries. whale watching lobbyists are concerned that the most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, will be the first to be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas.[118] whale watching generated us$2.1 billion (gb£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers.[119] in contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates us$31 million (gb£20 million) per year.[95] the size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource. as marine creatures that reside in either the depths or the poles, humans knew very little about whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. the vikings and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were important pieces of their lives. in inuit creation myths, when 'big raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the great spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. in an icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. the man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him. whales played a major part in shaping the art forms of many coastal civilizations, such as the norse, with some dating to the stone age. petroglyphs off a cliff face in bangudae, south korea show 300 depictions of various animals, a third of which are whales. some show particular detail in which there are throat pleats, typical of rorquals. these petroglyphs show these people, of around 7,000 to 3,500 b.c.e. in south korea, had a very high dependency on whales.[120] the pacific islanders and australian aborigines viewed whales as bringers of good and joy. one exception is french polynesia, where, in many parts, cetaceans are met with great brutality.[121] in vietnam and ghana, among other places, whales hold a sense of divinity. they are so respected in their cultures that they occasionally hold funerals for beached whales, a throwback to vietnam's ancient sea-based austro-asiatic culture.[122][123][124][125] the god of the seas, according to chinese folklore, was a large whale with human limbs. whales have also played a role in sacred texts. the story of jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the qur'an[126] and in the biblical book of jonah (and is mentioned by jesus in the new testament: matthew 12:40.[127]). this episode was frequently depicted in medieval art (for example, on a 12th-century column capital at the abbey church of mozac, france). the bible also mentions whales in genesis 1:21, job 7:12, and ezekiel 32:2. the ""leviathan"" described at length in job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. the ""sea monsters"" in lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word ""jackals"" instead.[128] in 1585, alessandro farnese, 1585, and francois, duke of anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of antwerp by floats including ""neptune and the whale"", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.[129] in 1896, an article in the pall mall gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of eden, australia two or three years earlier.[130] it was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.[131] whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. for example, herman melville's moby dick features a ""great white whale"" as the main antagonist for ahab, who eventually is killed by it. the whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale mocha dick. rudyard kipling's just so stories includes the story of ""how the whale got in his throat"". a whale features in the award-winning children's book the snail and the whale (2003) by julia donaldson and axel scheffler. niki caro's film the whale rider has a māori girl ride a whale in her journey to be a suitable heir to the chieftain-ship.[132] walt disney's film pinocchio features a showdown with a giant whale named monstro at the end of the film. a recording of song with a humpback whale by a team of marine scientists became popular in 1970. alan hovhaness's orchestral composition and god created great whales (1970) includes the recorded sounds of humpback and bowhead whales.[133] recorded whale songs also appear in a number of other musical works, including léo ferré's song ""il n'y a plus rien"" and judy collins's ""farewell to tarwathie"" (on the 1970 album whales and nightingales). belugas were the first whales to be kept in captivity. other species were too rare, too shy, or too big. the first beluga was shown at barnum's museum in new york city in 1861.[134] for most of the 20th century, canada was the predominant source of wild belugas.[135] they were taken from the st. lawrence river estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the churchill river estuary until capture was banned in 1992.[135] russia has become the largest provider since it had been banned in canada.[135] belugas are caught in the amur river delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or dolphinariums in moscow, st. petersburg, and sochi, or exported to other countries, such as canada.[135] most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.[136] as of 2006, 30 belugas were in canada and 28 in the united states, and 42 deaths in captivity had been reported up to that time.[135] a single specimen can reportedly fetch up to us$100,000 (gb£64,160) on the market. the beluga's popularity is due to its unique colour and its facial expressions. the latter is possible because while most cetacean ""smiles"" are fixed, the extra movement afforded by the beluga's unfused cervical vertebrae allows a greater range of apparent expression.[137] between 1960 and 1992, the navy carried out a program that included the study of marine mammals' abilities with sonar, with the objective of improving the detection of underwater objects. a large number of belugas were used from 1975 on, the first being dolphins.[137][138] the program also included training them to carry equipment and material to divers working underwater by holding cameras in their mouths to locate lost objects, survey ships and submarines, and underwater monitoring.[138] a similar program was used by the russian navy during the cold war, in which belugas were also trained for antimining operations in the arctic.[139] aquariums have tried housing other species of whales in captivity. the success of belugas turned attention to maintaining their relative, the narwhal, in captivity. however, in repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, all narwhals kept in captivity died within months. a pair of pygmy right whales were retained in an enclosed area (with nets); they were eventually released in south africa. there was one attempt to keep a stranded sowerby's beaked whale calf in captivity; the calf rammed into the tank wall, breaking its rostrum, which resulted in death. it was thought that sowerby's beaked whale evolved to swim fast in a straight line, and a 30-metre (98 ft) tank was not big enough.[140] there have been attempts to keep baleen whales in captivity. there were three attempts to keep grey whales in captivity. gigi was a grey whale calf that died in transport. gigi ii was another grey whale calf that was captured in the ojo de liebre lagoon, and was transported to seaworld.[141] the 680-kilogram (1,500 lb) calf was a popular attraction, and behaved normally, despite being separated from his mother. a year later, the 8,000-kilogram (18,000 lb) whale grew too big to keep in captivity and was released; it was the first of two grey whales, the other being another grey whale calf named jj, to successfully be kept in captivity.[141] there were three attempts to keep minke whales in captivity in japan. they were kept in a tidal pool with a sea-gate at the izu mito sea paradise. another, unsuccessful, attempt was made by the u.s. [142] one stranded humpback whale calf was kept in captivity for rehabilitation, but died days later.[143] "
man," a man is an adult male human. prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy. like most other male mammals, a man's genome inherits an x chromosome from his mother and a y chromosome from his father. the male fetus produces larger amounts of androgens and smaller amounts of estrogens than a female fetus. this difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women. during puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. however, there are exceptions to the above for some transgender and intersex men. the english term ""man"" is derived from the proto-indo-european root *man- (see sanskrit/avestan manu-, slavic mǫž ""man, male"").[1] more directly, the word derives from old english mann. the old english form primarily meant ""person"" or ""human being"" and referred to men, women, and children alike. the old english word for ""man"" was wer. mann only came to mean ""man"" in middle english, replacing wer, which survives today only in the compound ""werewolf"" (from old english werwulf, literallly ""man-wolf"").[2][3] in human beings, the sex of an individual is determined at the time of fertilization by the genetic material carried in the sperm cell. if a sperm cell carrying an x chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be female (xx). on the other hand, if a sperm cell carrying a y chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be male (xy). persons whose anatomy or chromosomal makeup differ from this pattern are referred to as intersex. like most other male mammals, a man's genome typically inherits an x chromosome from his mother and a y chromosome from his father. the male fetus produces larger amounts of androgens and smaller amounts of estrogens than a female fetus. this difference in the relative amounts of these sex steroids is largely responsible for the physiological differences that distinguish men from women. humans exhibit sexual dimorphism in many characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability, although most of these characteristics do have a role in sexual attraction. most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern. for example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species. primary sex characteristics (or sex organs) are characteristics that are present at birth and are integral to the reproductive process. for men, primary sex characteristics include the penis and testicles. secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during puberty in humans.[4][5] such features are especially evident in the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish between the sexes, but—unlike the primary sex characteristics—are not directly part of the reproductive system.[6][7][8] secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include: the male reproductive system includes external and internal genitalia. the male external genitalia consist of the penis, the male urethra, and the scrotum, while the male internal genitalia consist of the testes, the prostate, the epididymis, the seminal vesicle, the vas deferens, the ejaculatory duct, and the bulbourethral gland.[11] the male reproductive system's function is to produce semen, which carries sperm and thus genetic information that can unite with an egg within a woman. since sperm that enters a woman's uterus and then fallopian tubes goes on to fertilize an egg which develops into a fetus or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the gestation. the study of male reproduction and associated organs is called andrology. in mammals, the hormones that influence sexual differentiation and development are androgens (mainly testosterone), which stimulate later development of the ovary. in the sexually undifferentiated embryo, testosterone stimulates the development of the wolffian ducts, the penis, and closure of the labioscrotal folds into the scrotum. another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the anti-müllerian hormone, which inhibits the development of the müllerian ducts. for males during puberty, testosterone, along with gonadotropins released by the pituitary gland, stimulates spermatogenesis. although in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women. men have lower life expectancy[12] and higher suicide rates[13] compared to women. male sexuality and attraction vary from person to person, and a man's sexual behavior can be affected by many factors, including evolved predispostions, personality, upbringing, and culture. while the majority of men are heterosexual, significant minorities are homosexual or bisexual.[14] some men identify as mostly straight.[15] a small percentage of people assigned female at birth may identify as male (typically referred to as transgender men). in contrast, some people assigned male at birth may identify as female (typically referred to as transgender woman). some people assigned male at birth may also identify as non-binary.[16] there are also intersex people who may identify as either female or male. masculinity (also sometimes called manhood or manliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with boys and men. although masculinity is socially constructed,[17] some research indicates that some behaviors considered masculine are biologically influenced.[18] to what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate.[18] it is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex, as both males and females can exhibit masculine traits.[19] standards of manliness or masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods.[20] while the outward signs of masculinity look different in different cultures, there are some common aspects to its definition across cultures. in all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.[21] in the late 20th century, some qualities traditionally associated with marriage (such as the ""triple ps"" of protecting, providing, and procreating) were still considered signs of having achieved manhood.[21][22] anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class. in western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status. many english words such as virtue and virile (from the indo-european root vir meaning man) reflect this.[23][24] the parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles. model a describes total separation of male and female roles, while model b describes the complete dissolution of barriers between gender roles.[25] medical: dynamics: political: "
wolf," see subspecies of canis lupus the wolf (canis lupus[a]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to eurasia and north america. more than thirty subspecies of canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as colloquially understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies. the wolf is the largest extant member of canidae, males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 37 kg (82 lb). wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height. the wolf is also distinguished from other canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. the wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. the banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white. of all members of the genus canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour. it travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. the wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. pathogens and parasites, notably rabies virus, may infect wolves. the global wild wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of least concern by the international union for conservation of nature (iucn). wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of their attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds. the english ""wolf"" stems from the old english wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the proto-germanic *wulfaz. the proto-indo-european root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the latin word for the animal lupus (*lúkʷos).[4][5] the name ""gray wolf"" refers to the grayish colour of the species.[6] since pre-christian times, germanic peoples such as the anglo-saxons took on wulf as a prefix or suffix in their names. examples include wulfhere (""wolf army"", or ""he whose army is the wolf""), cynewulf (""royal wolf""), cēnwulf (""bold wolf""), wulfheard (""wolf-hard""), earnwulf (""eagle wolf""), wulfstān (""wolf stone"") æðelwulf (""noble wolf""), wolfhroc (""wolf-frock""), wolfhetan (""wolf hide""), isangrim (""gray mask""), scrutolf (""garb wolf""), wolfgang (""wolf gait"") and wolfdregil (""wolf runner"").[7] gray wolf coyote african golden wolf ethiopian wolf golden jackal dhole african wild dog side-striped jackal black-backed jackal in 1758, the swedish botanist and zoologist carl linnaeus published in his systema naturae the binomial nomenclature.[3] canis is the latin word meaning ""dog"",[9] and under this genus he listed the doglike carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. he classified the domestic dog as canis familiaris, and the wolf as canis lupus.[3] linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its cauda recurvata—its upturning tail—which is not found in any other canid.[10] in the third edition of mammal species of the world published in 2005, the mammalogist w. christopher wozencraft listed under c. lupus 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: familiaris (linnaeus, 1758) and dingo (meyer, 1793). wozencraft included hallstromi—the new guinea singing dog—as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo. wozencraft referred to a 1999 mitochondrial dna study as one of the guides in forming his decision, and listed the 38 subspecies of c. lupus under the biological common name of ""wolf"", the nominate subspecies being the eurasian wolf (c. l. lupus) based on the type specimen that linnaeus studied in sweden.[11] studies using paleogenomic techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are sister taxa, as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first domesticated.[12] in 2019, a workshop hosted by the iucn/species survival commission's canid specialist group considered the new guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs canis familiaris, and therefore should not be assessed for the iucn red list.[13] the phylogenetic descent of the extant wolf c. lupus from c. etruscus through c. mosbachensis is widely accepted.[14] the earliest fossils of c. lupus were found in what was once eastern beringia at old crow, yukon, canada, and at cripple creek sump, fairbanks, alaska. the age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago. considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the late pleistocene. they had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened snout, a pronounced development of the temporalis muscle, and robust premolars. it is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of pleistocene megafauna. compared with modern wolves, some pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage similar to that seen in the extinct dire wolf. this suggests they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. compared with those found in the modern spotted hyena, the frequency and location of tooth fractures in these wolves indicates they were habitual bone crackers.[15] in june 2019, the severed yet preserved head of a pleistocene wolf, dated to over 40,000 years ago, was found close to the tirekhtyakh river in yakutia, russia, near the arctic circle. the head was about 16 in (41 cm) long, much bigger than a modern wolf's head.[16][17][18] genomic studies suggest modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population[19][20][21] that existed 20,000 years ago.[19] studies in 2017 and 2018 found that the himalayan wolf is part of a lineage that is basal to other wolves and split from them 691,000–740,000 years ago.[22][23] other wolves appear to have originated in beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes during the close of the late pleistocene.[23] a study in 2016 indicates that a population bottleneck was followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the last glacial maximum. this implies the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.[24] a 2016 genomic study suggests that old world and new world wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the divergence of the lineage that led to dogs from other old world wolves around 11,100–12,300 years ago.[21] an extinct late pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog,[25][15] with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two.[15] the dingo, basenji, tibetan mastiff and chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. the divergence time for wolves in europe, the middle east, and asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. among new world wolves, the mexican wolf diverged around 5,400 years ago.[21] in the distant past, there has been gene flow between african golden wolves, golden jackals, and gray wolves. the african golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically admixed canid of 72% wolf and 28% ethiopian wolf ancestry. one african golden wolf from the egyptian sinai peninsula shows admixture with middle eastern wolves and dogs.[26] there is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and middle eastern wolves, less so with european and asian wolves, and least with north american wolves. this indicates the golden jackal ancestry found in north american wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the eurasian and north american wolves.[27] the common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a ghost population of an extinct unidentified canid. this canid is genetically close to the dhole and evolved after the divergence of the african hunting dog from the other canid species. the basal position of the coyote compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid.[26] similarly, a museum specimen of a wolf from southern china collected in 1963 showed a genome that was 12–14% admixed from this unknown canid.[28] in north america, most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture. the red wolf of the southeastern united states is a hybrid animal with 40%:60% wolf to coyote ancestry. in addition, there was found to be 60%:40% wolf to coyote genetics in eastern timber wolves, and 75%:25% in the great lakes region wolves.[27] in more recent times, some male italian wolves originated from dog ancestry, which indicates female wolves will breed with male dogs in the wild.[29] in the caucasus mountains, ten percent of dogs including livestock guardian dogs, are first generation hybrids.[30] although mating between golden jackals and wolves has never been observed, evidence of jackal-wolf hybridization was discovered through mitochondrial dna analysis of jackals living in the caucasus mountains[30] and in bulgaria.[31] the wolf is the largest member of the canidae family,[32] and is further distinguished from coyotes and jackals by a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and a longer tail.[33][32] it is slender and powerfully built with a large, deeply descending rib cage, a sloping back, and a heavily muscled neck.[34] the wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range in winter.[35] the ears are relatively small and triangular.[34] the wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle.[36] the skull is 230–280 mm (9–11 in) in length and 130–150 mm (5–6 in) in width.[37] the teeth are heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids. they are not as specialized as those found in hyenas though.[38][39] its molars have a flat chewing surface, but not to the same extent as the coyote, whose diet contains more vegetable matter.[40] females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs, and less massive shoulders than males.[41] adult wolves measure 105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder height.[36] the tail measures 29–50 cm (11–20 in) in length, the ears 90–110 mm (3 1⁄2–4 3⁄8 in) in height, and the hind feet are 220–250 mm (8 5⁄8–9 7⁄8 in).[42] the size and weight of the modern wolf increases proportionally with latitude in accord with bergmann's rule.[43] the mean body mass of the wolf is 40 kg (88 lb), the smallest specimen recorded at 12 kg (26 lb) and the largest at 79.4 kg (175 lb).[44][36] on average, european wolves weigh 38.5 kg (85 lb), north american wolves 36 kg (79 lb), and indian and arabian wolves 25 kg (55 lb).[45] females in any given wolf population typically weigh 2.3–4.5 kg (5–10 lb) less than males. wolves weighing over 54 kg (119 lb) are uncommon, though exceptionally large individuals have been recorded in alaska and canada.[46] in middle russia, exceptionally large males are given a maximum weight of 69–79 kg (152–174 lb).[42] the wolf has very dense and fluffy winter fur, with a short undercoat and long, coarse guard hairs.[36] most of the undercoat and some guard hairs are shed in spring and grow back in autumn.[45] the longest hairs occur on the back, particularly on the front quarters and neck. especially long hairs grow on the shoulders and almost form a crest on the upper part of the neck. the hairs on the cheeks are elongated and form tufts. the ears are covered in short hairs and project from the fur. short, elastic and closely adjacent hairs are present on the limbs from the elbows down to the calcaneal tendons.[36] the winter fur is highly resistant to the cold. wolves in northern climates can rest comfortably in open areas at −40 °c (−40 °f) by placing their muzzles between the rear legs and covering their faces with their tail. wolf fur provides better insulation than dog fur and does not collect ice when warm breath is condensed against it.[45] in cold climates, the wolf can reduce the flow of blood near its skin to conserve body heat. the warmth of the foot pads is regulated independently from the rest of the body and is maintained at just above tissue-freezing point where the pads come in contact with ice and snow.[47] in warm climates, the fur is coarser and scarcer than in northern wolves.[36] female wolves tend to have smoother furred limbs than males and generally develop the smoothest overall coats as they age. older wolves generally have more white hairs on the tip of the tail, along the nose, and on the forehead. winter fur is retained longest by lactating females, although with some hair loss around their teats.[41] hair length on the middle of the back is 60–70 mm (2 3⁄8–2 3⁄4 in), and the guard hairs on the shoulders generally do not exceed 90 mm (3 1⁄2 in), but can reach 110–130 mm (4 3⁄8–5 1⁄8 in).[36] a wolf's coat colour is determined by its guard hairs. wolves usually have some hairs that are white, brown, gray and black.[48] the coat of the eurasian wolf is a mixture of ochreous (yellow to orange) and rusty ochreous (orange/red/brown) colours with light gray. the muzzle is pale ochreous gray, and the area of the lips, cheeks, chin, and throat is white. the top of the head, forehead, under and between the eyes, and between the eyes and ears is gray with a reddish film. the neck is ochreous. long, black tips on the hairs along the back form a broad stripe, with black hair tips on the shoulders, upper chest and rear of the body. the sides of the body, tail, and outer limbs are a pale dirty ochreous colour, while the inner sides of the limbs, belly, and groin are white. apart from those wolves which are pure white or black, these tones vary little across geographical areas, although the patterns of these colours vary between individuals.[49] in north america, the coat colours of wolves follow gloger's rule, wolves in the canadian arctic being white and those in southern canada, the u.s., and mexico being predominantly gray. in some areas of the rocky mountains of alberta and british columbia, the coat colour is predominantly black, some being blue-gray and some with silver and black.[48] differences in coat colour between sexes is absent in eurasia;[50] females tend to have redder tones in north america.[51] black-coloured wolves in north america acquired their colour from wolf-dog admixture after the first arrival of dogs across the bering strait 12,000 to 14,000 years ago.[52] research into the inheritance of white colour from dogs into wolves has yet to be undertaken.[53] wolves occurred originally across eurasia and north america. deliberate human persecution because of livestock predation and fear of attacks on humans has reduced the wolf's range to about one-third of what it once was. the wolf is now extirpated (locally extinct) in much of western europe, the united states and mexico, and in japan. in modern times, the wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas. the wolf can be found between sea level and 3,000 m (9,800 ft). wolves live in forests, inland wetlands, shrublands, grasslands (including arctic tundra), pastures, deserts, and rocky peaks on mountains.[2] habitat use by wolves depends on the abundance of prey, snow conditions, livestock densities, road densities, human presence and topography.[40] like all land mammals that are pack hunters, the wolf feeds predominantly on wild herbivorous hoofed mammals that can be divided into large size 240–650 kg (530–1,430 lb) and medium size 23–130 kg (51–287 lb), and have a body mass similar to that of the combined mass of the pack members.[54][55] the wolf specializes in preying on the vulnerable individuals of large prey,[40] with a pack of 15 able to bring down an adult moose.[56] the variation in diet between wolves living on different continents is based on the variety of hoofed mammals and of available smaller and domesticated prey.[57] in north america, the wolf's diet is dominated by wild large hoofed mammals (ungulates) and medium-sized mammals. in asia and europe, their diet is dominated by wild medium-sized hoofed mammals and domestic species. the wolf depends on wild species, and if these are not readily available, as in asia, the wolf is more reliant on domestic species.[57] across eurasia, wolves prey mostly on bison,[58] moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar.[59] in north america, important range-wide prey are elk, moose, caribou, white-tailed deer, mule deer, bison[60] and musk oxen.[61][62] wolves can digest their meal in a few hours and can feed several times in one day, making quick use of large quantities of meat.[63] a well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.[64] nonetheless, wolves are not fussy eaters. smaller-sized animals that may supplement their diet include rodents, hares, insectivores and smaller carnivores. they frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs. when such foods are insufficient, they prey on lizards, snakes, frogs, and large insects when available.[65] wolves in northern minnesota prey on northern pike in freshwater streams.[66] the diet of coastal wolves in alaska includes 20% salmon,[67] while those of coastal wolves in british columbia includes 25% marine sources, and those on the nearby islands 75%.[68] in europe, wolves eat apples, pears, figs, melons, berries and cherries. in north america, wolves eat blueberries and raspberries. wolves also eat grass, which may provide some vitamins.[69] they are known to eat the berries of mountain-ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, cowberries, european black nightshade, grain crops, and the shoots of reeds.[65] in times of scarcity, wolves will readily eat carrion.[65] in eurasian areas with dense human activity, many wolf populations are forced to subsist largely on livestock and garbage.[59] prey in north america continue to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, the wolves eating livestock and garbage only in dire circumstances.[70] cannibalism is not uncommon in wolves during harsh winters, when packs often attack weak or injured wolves and may eat the bodies of dead pack members.[65][71][72] wolves typically dominate other canid species in areas where they both occur. in north america, incidents of wolves killing coyotes are common, particularly in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills. wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and killing their pups, though rarely eating them. there are no records of coyotes killing wolves, though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them.[73] according to a press release by the u.s. department of agriculture in 1921, the infamous custer wolf relied on coyotes to accompany him and warn him of danger. though they fed from his kills, he never allowed them to approach him.[74] interactions have been observed in eurasia between wolves and golden jackals, the latter's numbers being comparatively small in areas with high wolf densities.[36][73][75] wolves also kill red, arctic and corsac foxes, usually in disputes over carcasses, sometimes eating them.[36][76] brown bears typically dominate wolf packs in disputes over carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites. both species kill each other's young. wolves eat the brown bears they kill, while brown bears seem to eat only young wolves.[77] wolf interactions with american black bears are much rarer because of differences in habitat preferences. wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions actively seeking out american black bears in their dens and killing them without eating them. unlike brown bears, american black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills.[78] wolves also dominate and sometimes kill wolverines, and will chase off those that attempt to scavenge from their kills. wolverines escape from wolves in caves or up trees.[79] wolves may interact and compete with felids, such as the eurasian lynx, which may feed on smaller prey where wolves are present[80] and may be suppressed by large wolf populations.[81] wolves encounter cougars along portions of the rocky mountains and adjacent mountain ranges. wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting at different elevations for different prey (niche partitioning). in winter, when snow accumulation forces their prey into valleys, interactions between the two species become more likely. wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal their kills or even kill them,[82] while one-to-one encounters tend to be dominated by the cat. there are several documented cases of cougars killing wolves.[83] wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities and disrupting the feline's behaviour.[84] wolf and siberian tiger interactions are well-documented in the russian far east, where tigers significantly depress wolf numbers, sometimes to the point of localized extinction. only human depletion of tiger numbers appears to protect wolves from competitive exclusion from them. with perhaps only four proven records of tigers killing wolves, these cases are rare; attacks appear to be competitive rather than predatory in nature.[85][80] in israel, central asia and india wolves may encounter striped hyenas, usually in disputes over carcasses. striped hyenas feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses in areas where the two species interact. one-to-one, hyenas dominate wolves, and may prey on them,[86] but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered hyenas.[87][88] there is at least one case in israel of a hyena associating and cooperating with a wolf pack. it is proposed that the hyena could benefit from the wolves' superior ability to hunt large, agile prey. the wolves could benefit from the hyena's superior sense of smell, to locate and dig out tortoises, to crack open large bones, and to tear open discarded food containers like tin cans.[89] the wolf is a social animal.[36] its populations consist of packs and lone wolves, most lone wolves being temporarily alone while they disperse from packs to form their own or join another one.[90] the wolf's basic social unit is the nuclear family consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring.[36] the average pack size in north america is eight wolves and in europe 5.5 wolves.[43] the average pack across eurasia consists of a family of eight wolves (two adults, juveniles, and yearlings),[36] or sometimes two or three such families,[40] with examples of exceptionally large packs consisting of up to 42 wolves being known.[91] cortisol levels in wolves rise significantly when a pack member dies, indicating the presence of stress.[92] during times of prey abundance caused by calving or migration, different wolf packs may join together temporarily.[36] offspring typically stay in the pack for 10–54 months before dispersing.[93] triggers for dispersal include the onset of sexual maturity and competition within the pack for food.[94] the distance travelled by dispersing wolves varies widely; some stay in the vicinity of the parental group, while other individuals may travel great distances of upwards of 206 km (128 mi), 390 km (240 mi), and 670 km (420 mi) from their natal (birth) packs.[95] a new pack is usually founded by an unrelated dispersing male and female, travelling together in search of an area devoid of other hostile packs.[96] wolf packs rarely adopt other wolves into their fold and typically kill them. in the rare cases where other wolves are adopted, the adoptee is almost invariably an immature animal of one to three years old, and unlikely to compete for breeding rights with the mated pair. this usually occurs between the months of february and may. adoptee males may mate with an available pack female and then form their own pack. in some cases, a lone wolf is adopted into a pack to replace a deceased breeder.[91] wolves are territorial and generally establish territories far larger than they require to survive assuring a steady supply of prey. territory size depends largely on the amount of prey available and the age of the pack's pups. they tend to increase in size in areas with low prey populations,[97] or when the pups reach the age of six months when they have the same nutritional needs as adults.[98] wolf packs travel constantly in search of prey, covering roughly 9% of their territory per day, on average 25 km/d (16 mi/d). the core of their territory is on average 35 km2 (14 sq mi) where they spend 50% of their time.[97] prey density tends to be much higher on the territory's periphery. except out of desperation, wolves tend to avoid hunting on the fringes of their range to avoid fatal confrontations with neighbouring packs.[99] the smallest territory on record was held by a pack of six wolves in northeastern minnesota, which occupied an estimated 33 km2 (13 sq mi), while the largest was held by an alaskan pack of ten wolves encompassing 6,272 km2 (2,422 sq mi).[98] wolf packs are typically settled, and usually leave their accustomed ranges only during severe food shortages.[36] wolves advertise their territories to other packs through howling and scent marking. scent marking involves urine, feces, and anal gland scents. this is more effective at advertising territory than howling and is often used in combination with scratch marks. wolves increase their rate of scent marking when they encounter the marks of wolves from other packs. lone wolves will rarely mark, but newly bonded pairs will scent mark the most.[40] these marks are generally left every 240 m (260 yd) throughout the territory on regular travelways and junctions. such markers can last for two to three weeks,[98] and are typically placed near rocks, boulders, trees, or the skeletons of large animals.[36] territorial fights are among the principal causes of wolf mortality, one study concluding that 14–65% of wolf deaths in minnesota and the denali national park and preserve were due to other wolves.[100] wolves communicate to anticipate what their pack mates or other wolves might do next.[101] this includes the use of vocalization, body posture, scent, touch, and taste.[102] the phases of the moon have no effect on wolf vocalization, and despite popular belief, wolves do not howl at the moon.[103] wolves howl to assemble the pack usually before and after hunts, to pass on an alarm particularly at a den site, to locate each other during a storm, while crossing unfamiliar territory, and to communicate across great distances.[104] wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to 130 km2 (50 sq mi).[40] other vocalizations include growls, barks and whines. wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as dogs do in confrontations, rather barking a few times and then retreating from a perceived danger.[105] aggressive or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, flatten their fur, and lower their ears and tail.[106] raised leg urination is considered to be one of the most important forms of scent communication in the wolf, making up 60–80% of all scent marks observed.[107] wolves are monogamous, mated pairs usually remaining together for life. should one of the pair die, another mate is found quickly.[108] with wolves in the wild, inbreeding does not occur where outbreeding is possible.[109] wolves become mature at the age of two years and sexually mature from the age of three years.[108] the age of first breeding in wolves depends largely on environmental factors: when food is plentiful, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages to better exploit abundant resources. females are capable of producing pups every year, one litter annually being the average.[110] oestrus and rut begin in the second half of winter and lasts for two weeks.[108] dens are usually constructed for pups during the summer period. when building dens, females make use of natural shelters like fissures in rocks, cliffs overhanging riverbanks and holes thickly covered by vegetation. sometimes, the den is the appropriated burrow of smaller animals such as foxes, badgers or marmots. an appropriated den is often widened and partly remade. on rare occasions, female wolves dig burrows themselves, which are usually small and short with one to three openings. the den is usually constructed not more than 500 m (550 yd) away from a water source. it typically faces southwards where it can be better warmed by sunlight exposure, and the snow can thaw more quickly. resting places, play areas for the pups, and food remains are commonly found around wolf dens. the odor of urine and rotting food emanating from the denning area often attracts scavenging birds like magpies and ravens. though they mostly avoid areas within human sight, wolves have been known to nest near domiciles, paved roads and railways.[111] during pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are less likely to occur.[112] the gestation period lasts 62–75 days with pups usually being born in the spring months or early summer in very cold places such as on the tundra. young females give birth to four to five young, and older females from six to eight young and up to 14. their mortality rate is 60–80%.[113] newborn wolf pups look similar to german shepherd dog pups.[114] they are born blind and deaf and are covered in short soft grayish-brown fur. they weigh 300–500 g (10 1⁄2–17 3⁄4 oz) at birth and begin to see after nine to 12 days. the milk canines erupt after one month. pups first leave the den after three weeks. at one-and-a-half months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger. mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young. pups begin to eat solid food at the age of three to four weeks. they have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life: during this period, a pup's weight can increase nearly 30 times.[113][115] wolf pups begin play-fighting at the age of three weeks, though unlike young coyotes and foxes, their bites are gentle and controlled. actual fights to establish hierarchy usually occur at five to eight weeks of age. this is in contrast to young coyotes and foxes, which may begin fighting even before the onset of play behaviour.[116] by autumn, the pups are mature enough to accompany the adults on hunts for large prey.[112] single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs; single wolves have occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose, bison and muskoxen unaided.[117][118] this contrasts with the commonly held belief that larger packs benefit from cooperative hunting to bring down large game.[118] the size of a wolf hunting pack is related to the number of pups that survived the previous winter, adult survival, and the rate of dispersing wolves leaving the pack. the optimal pack size for hunting elk is four wolves, and for bison a large pack size is more successful.[119] as well as their physical adaptations for hunting hoofed mammals, wolves possess certain behavioural, cognitive, and psychological adaptations to assist with their hunting lifestyle. wolves are excellent learners that match or outperform domestic dogs. they can use gaze to focus attention on where other wolves are looking. this is important because wolves do not use vocalization when hunting. in laboratory tests, they appear to exhibit insight, foresight, understanding, and the ability to plan. to survive, wolves must be able to solve two problems—finding a prey animal, then confronting it.[120] wolves move around their territory when hunting, using the same trails for extended periods. after snowfalls, wolves find their old trails and continue using them. these follow the banks of rivers, the shorelines of lakes, through ravines overgrown with shrubs, through plantations, or roads and human paths.[121] wolves are nocturnal predators. during the winter, a pack will commence hunting in the twilight of early evening and will hunt all night, traveling tens of kilometres. sometimes hunting large prey occurs during the day. during the summer, wolves generally tend to hunt individually, ambushing their prey and rarely giving pursuit.[122] the wolf usually travels at a loping pace, placing one of its paws directly in front of the other. this gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of 8–9 km/h (5.0–5.6 mph).[123] on bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of 50–60 km/h (31–37 mph). the wolf has a running gait of 55–70 km/h (34–43 mph), can leap 5 m (16 ft) horizontally in a single bound, and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 20 minutes.[95] a wolf's foot is large and flexible, which allows it to tread on a wide variety of terrain. a wolf's legs are long compared to their body size allowing them to travel up to 76 km (47 mi) in 12 hours. this adaptation allows wolves to locate prey within hours, but it can take days to find prey that can be killed without great risk. moose and deer live singly in the summer. caribou live in herds of thousands which presents dangers for wolves. elk live in small herds and these are a safer target.[120] a wolf carries its head at the same level as its back, lifting it only when alert.[36] in one study, wolves detected moose using scent ten times, vision six times, and once by following tracks in the snow. their vision is as good as a human's, and they can smell prey at least 2.4 km (1 1⁄2 mi) away. one wolf travelled to a herd 103 km (64 mi) away. a human can detect the smell of a forest fire over the same distance from downwind. the wolf's sense of smell is at least comparable to that of the domestic dog, which is at least ten thousand times more sensitive than a human's.[120] when hunting large gregarious prey, wolves will try to isolate an individual from its group.[124] if successful, a wolf pack can bring down game that will feed it for days, but one error in judgement can lead to serious injury or death. most large prey have developed defensive adaptations and behaviours. wolves have been killed while attempting to bring down bison, elk, moose, muskoxen, and even by one of their smallest hoofed prey, the white-tailed deer. with smaller prey like beaver, geese, and hares, there is no risk to the wolf.[120] although people often believe wolves can easily overcome any of their prey, their success rate in hunting hoofed prey is usually low.[125] generally, bison, elk, and moose will stand their ground, then the wolves must struggle with them to bring them down. often caribou and deer will flee, but sometimes deer also make a stand.[120] if the targeted animal stands its ground, wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.[117] wolves, or even a wolf on its own, will attempt to frighten a herd into panicking and dispersing.[126] when wolves encounter prey that flees, they give chase. the speed of sprinting prey is closely related to the speed of their main predators. wolves can run at 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph) across several kilometres and will often pursue prey for at least 1 km (0.62 mi). one wolf chased a caribou for 8 km (5 mi), another chased and tracked a deer for 20 km (12 mi), and one 11-year-old wolf chased and caught an arctic hare after seven minutes. most wolf prey will try to run to water, where they will either escape or be better placed to attempt to ward off the wolves.[120] the wolf must give chase and gain on its fleeing prey, slow it down by biting through thick hair and hide, and then disable it enough to begin feeding.[120] after chasing and then confronting a large prey animal, the wolf makes use of its 6 cm (2 1⁄2 in) fangs and its powerful masseter muscles to deliver a bite force of 28 kg/cm2 (400 lbf/in2), which is capable of breaking open the skulls of many of its prey animals. the wolf leaps at its quarry and tears at it. one wolf was observed being dragged for dozens of metres attached to the hind leg of a moose; another was seen being dragged over a fallen log while attached to a bull elk's nose.[119] the most common point of wolf attacks on moose is the upper hind legs.[127][128][129] hind leg wounds are inflicted from the rear, midway up the hock with the canine teeth. these leave gaping skin perforations over 4 cm (1 1⁄2 in) in diameter. although blood loss, muscle damage, and tendon exposure may occur, there is no evidence of hamstringing. attacks also occur on the fleshy nose, the back and sides of the neck, the ears, and the perineum.[129] wolves may wound large prey and then lie around resting for hours before killing it when it is weaker due to blood loss, thereby lessening the risk of injury to themselves.[130] with medium-sized prey, such as roe deer or sheep, wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the carotid artery, thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute. with small, mouselike prey, wolves leap in a high arc and immobilize it with their forepaws.[131] when prey is vulnerable and abundant, wolves may occasionally surplus kill. such instances are common with domestic animals, but rare with wild prey. in the wild, surplus killing occurs primarily during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey)[132] or during the denning period, when den bound wolves require a ready supply of meat.[133] medium-sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throat-biting method allows wolves to kill one animal quickly and move on to another.[131] once prey is brought down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and tugging at the carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it.[134] the breeding pair typically monopolizes food to continue producing pups. when food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially non-pups.[135] the breeding pair typically eats first. they usually work the hardest at killing prey, and may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat undisturbed. once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transports them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs, like the heart, liver, lungs, and stomach lining. the kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles.[136] a wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.[64] viral diseases carried by wolves include: rabies, canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, papillomatosis, and canine coronavirus.[137] wolves are a major host for rabies in russia, iran, afghanistan, iraq and india.[138] in wolves, the incubation period is eight to 21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to 80 km (50 mi) a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in canada and alaska. the canine parvovirus, which causes death by dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and endotoxic shock or sepsis, is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely does not cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviours. the canine coronavirus has been recorded in alaskan wolves, infections being most prevalent in winter months.[137] bacterial diseases carried by wolves include: brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis,[139] listeriosis and anthrax.[138] wolves can catch brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. while adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to significantly affect wolf populations. leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have killed two wolf pups in canada.[139] wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites; those in the former soviet union have been recorded to carry at least 50 species.[138] most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.[140] parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people. wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. in areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.[138] wolves are often infested with a variety of arthropod exoparasites, including fleas, ticks, lice, and mites. the most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is the mange mite (sarcoptes scabiei),[140] though they rarely develop full-blown mange, unlike foxes.[36] lice, such as trichodectes canis, may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. ticks of the genus ixodes can infect wolves with lyme disease and rocky mountain spotted fever.[140] the tick dermacentor pictus also infests wolves. other ectoparasites include chewing lice, sucking lice and the fleas pulex irritans and ctenocephalides canis.[36] endoparasites known to infect wolves include: protozoans and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: isospora, toxoplasma, sarcocystis, babesia, and giardia.[140] some wolves carry neospora caninum, which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine miscarriages.[141] among flukes, the most common in north american wolves is alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians which are eaten by wolves. upon reaching maturity, alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but does little harm. metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. infections by the tapeworm echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.[140] wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in the uterus, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. wolves may catch dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100 cm (40 in). d. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. wolves can tolerate low levels of dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. wolves probably become infected with trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. although t. spiralis is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in russian wolves: nicolla skrjabini, macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and moniliformis moniliformis.[140] the global wild wolf population in 2003 was estimated at 300,000.[142] wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s. this has fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range as a result of legal protection, changes in land use, and rural human population shifts to cities. competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf. despite these threats, the iucn classifies the wolf as least concern on its red list due to its relatively widespread range and stable population. the species is listed by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora in its appendix ii, indicating that it is not threatened with extinction. however, those wolf populations living in bhutan, india, nepal and pakistan are listed in its appendix i, indicating that these may become extinct without restrictions on their trade.[2] in canada, 50,000–60,000 wolves live in 80% of their historical range, making canada an important stronghold for the species.[40] under canadian law, first nations people can hunt wolves without restrictions, but others must acquire licenses for the hunting and trapping seasons. as many as 4,000 wolves may be harvested in canada each year.[143] the wolf is a protected species in national parks under the canada national parks act.[144] in alaska, 7,000–11,000 wolves are found on 85% of the state's 1,517,733 km2 (586,000 sq mi). wolves may be hunted or trapped with a license; around 1,200 wolves are harvested annually.[145] in the contiguous united states, wolf declines were caused by the expansion of agriculture, the decimation of the wolf's main prey species like the american bison, and extermination campaigns.[40] wolves were given protection under the endangered species act (esa) of 1973, and have since returned to parts of their former range thanks to both natural recolonizations and reintroductions.[146] wolf populations in the great lakes states of minnesota, wisconsin and michigan number over 4,000 as of 2018.[147] wolves also occupy much of the northern rocky mountains region, with at least 1,704 wolves in montana, idaho and wyoming as of 2015. they have also established populations in washington and oregon.[148] on october 29, 2020, it was announced that the wolf would be delisted from the esa.[149][150] in mexico and parts of the southwestern united states, the mexican and u.s. governments collaborated from 1977 to 1980 in capturing all mexican wolves remaining in the wild to prevent their extinction and established captive breeding programs for reintroduction.[151] as of 2018, there were 230 mexican wolves living in mexico, 64 in arizona, 67 in new mexico, and 240 in captive breeding programs in both countries.[152] europe, excluding russia, belarus and ukraine, has 17,000 wolves in more than 28 countries.[153] in many countries of the european union, the wolf is strictly protected under the 1979 berne convention on the conservation of european wildlife and natural habitats (appendix ii) and the 1992 council directive 92/43/eec on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (annex ii and iv). there is extensive legal protection in many european countries, although there are national exceptions.[2][154] wolves have been persecuted in europe for centuries, having been exterminated in great britain by 1684, in ireland by 1770, in central europe by 1899, in france by the 1930s, and in much of scandinavia by the early 1970s. they continued to survive in parts of finland, eastern europe and southern europe.[155] since 1980, european wolves have rebounded and expanded into parts of their former range. the decline of the traditional pastoral and rural economies seems to have ended the need to exterminate the wolf in parts of europe.[143] as of 2016, estimates of wolf numbers include: 4,000 in the balkans, 3,460–3,849 in the carpathian mountains, 1,700–2,240 in the baltic states, 1,100–2,400 in the italian peninsula, and around 2,500 in the northwest iberian peninsula as of 2007.[153] in the former soviet union, wolf populations have retained much of their historical range despite soviet-era large scale extermination campaigns. their numbers range from 1,500 in georgia, to 20,000 in kazakhstan and up to 45,000 in russia.[156] in russia, the wolf is regarded as a pest because of its attacks on livestock, and wolf management means controlling their numbers by destroying them throughout the year. russian history over the past century shows that reduced hunting leads to an abundance of wolves.[157] the russian government has continued to pay bounties for wolves and annual harvests of 20–30% do not appear to significantly affect their numbers.[158] during the 19th century, wolves were widespread in many parts of the holy land east and west of the jordan river, but decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980, largely due to persecution by farmers.[159] in the middle east, only israel and oman give wolves explicit legal protection.[160] israel has protected its wolves since 1954 and has maintained a moderately sized population of 150 through effective enforcement of conservation policies. these wolves have moved into neighboring countries. approximately 300–600 wolves inhabit the arabian peninsula.[161] the wolf also appears to be widespread in iran.[162] turkey has an estimated population of about 7,000 wolves.[163] outside of turkey, wolf populations in the middle east may total 1,000–2,000.[160] in southern asia, the northern regions of afghanistan and pakistan are important strongholds for wolves. the wolf has been protected in india since 1972.[164] hindus traditionally considered the hunting of wolves, even dangerous ones, as taboo, for fear of causing a bad harvest. the santals considered them fair game, as they did every other forest-dwelling animal.[165] during british rule in india, wolves were not considered game species, and were killed primarily in response to them attacking game herds, livestock, and people.[166] the indian wolf is distributed across the states of gujarat, rajasthan, haryana, uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, karnataka and andhra pradesh.[167] as of 2019, it is estimated that there are around 2,000–3,000 indian wolves in the country.[168] in east asia, mongolia's population numbers 10,000–20,000. in china, heilongjiang has roughly 650 wolves, xinjiang has 10,000 and tibet has 2,000.[169] 2017 evidence suggests that wolves range across all of mainland china.[170] wolves have been historically persecuted in china[171] but have been legally protected since 1998.[172] the last japanese wolf was captured and killed in 1905.[173] the wolf is a common motif in the mythologies and cosmologies of peoples throughout its historical range. the ancient greeks associated wolves with apollo, the god of light and order.[174] the ancient romans connected the wolf with their god of war and agriculture mars,[175] and believed their city's founders, romulus and remus, were suckled by a she-wolf.[176] norse mythology includes the feared giant wolf fenrir, eldest child of loki and the giantess angrboda,[177] and geri and freki, odin's faithful pets.[178] the wolf was held in high esteem by the dacians, who viewed it as the lord of all animals and as the only effective defender against evil.[179] in the pawnee creation myth, the wolf was the first animal brought to earth. when humans killed it, they were punished with death, destruction and the loss of immortality.[180] for the pawnee, sirius is the ""wolf star"" and its disappearance and reappearance signified the wolf moving to and from the spirit world. both pawnee and blackfoot call the milky way the ""wolf trail"".[181] the wolf is also an important totem animal for the tlingit and tsimshian.[182] in chinese astronomy, the wolf represents sirius as the ""blue beast"" and the star itself is called the ""heavenly wolf"".[183] in china, the wolf was traditionally associated with greed and cruelty and wolf epithets were used to describe negative behaviours such as cruelty (""wolf's heart""), mistrust (""wolf's look"") and lechery (""wolf-sex"").[184] tengrism places high importance on the wolf, as it is thought that, when howling, it is praying to tengri, thus making it the only creature other than man to worship a deity.[185] in both hinduism and buddhism, the wolf is ridden by gods of protection. in vedic hinduism, the wolf is a symbol of the night and the daytime quail must escape from its jaws.[184] in hindu mythology, krishna, to convince the people of vraja to migrate to vṛndāvana, creates hundreds of wolves from his hairs, which frighten the inhabitants of vraja into making the journey.[186] in tantric buddhism, wolves are depicted as inhabitants of graveyards and destroyers of corpses.[184] in zoroastrianism, the wolf has been demonized as the creation of ahriman.[187] the concept of people turning into wolves, and the inverse, has been present in many cultures. one greek myth tells of lycaon of arcadia being transformed into a wolf by zeus as punishment for his evil deeds.[188] the legend of the werewolf has been widespread in european folklore and involves people willingly turning into wolves to attack and kill others.[189] the navajo have traditionally believed that witches would turn into wolves by donning wolf skins and would kill people and raid graveyards.[190] the dena'ina believed wolves were once men and viewed them as brothers.[174] similarly, in turkic mythology wolves were believed to be the ancestors of their people.[191] aesop featured wolves in several of his fables, playing on the concerns of ancient greece's settled, sheep-herding world. his most famous is the fable of ""the boy who cried wolf"", which is directed at those who knowingly raise false alarms, and from which the idiomatic phrase ""to cry wolf"" is derived. some of his other fables concentrate on maintaining the trust between shepherds and guard dogs in their vigilance against wolves, as well as anxieties over the close relationship between wolves and dogs. although aesop used wolves to warn, criticize and moralize about human behaviour, his portrayals added to the wolf's image as a deceitful and dangerous animal.[192] the bible contains 13 references to wolves, usually as metaphors for greed and destructiveness. in the new testament, jesus is said to have used wolves as illustrations of the dangers his followers, whom he represents as sheep, would face should they follow him.(matthew 7:15, matthew 10:16 and acts 20:29).[193] in the jataka tales the wolf is portrayed as a trickster, including one story in which it makes a hunter stop playing dead by pulling on his club.[194] in another story, the wolf tricks and eats some rats by pretending to be lame but is foiled by the chief rat.[195] isengrim the wolf, a character first appearing in the 12th-century latin poem ysengrimus, is a major character in the reynard cycle, where he stands for the low nobility, whilst his adversary, reynard the fox, represents the peasant hero. isengrim is forever the victim of reynard's wit and cruelty, often dying at the end of each story.[196] the tale of ""little red riding hood"", first written in 1697 by charles perrault, is considered to have further contributed to the wolf's negative reputation in the western world. the big bad wolf is portrayed as a villain capable of imitating human speech and disguising itself with human clothing. the character has been interpreted as an allegorical sexual predator.[197] villainous wolf characters also appear in the three little pigs and ""the wolf and the seven young goats"".[198] the hunting of wolves, and their attacks on humans and livestock, feature prominently in russian literature, and are included in the works of leo tolstoy, anton chekhov, nikolay nekrasov, ivan bunin, leonid pavlovich sabaneyev, and others. tolstoy's war and peace and chekhov's peasants both feature scenes in which wolves are hunted with hounds and borzois.[199] the musical peter and the wolf involves a wolf being captured for eating a farm duck, but is spared and sent to a zoo.[200] wolves are among the central characters of rudyard kipling's the jungle book. his portrayal of wolves has been praised posthumously by wolf biologists for his depiction of them: rather than being villainous or gluttonous, as was common in wolf portrayals at the time of the book's publication, they are shown as living in amiable family groups and drawing on the experience of infirm but experienced elder pack members.[201] farley mowat's largely fictional 1963 memoir never cry wolf is widely considered to be the most popular book on wolves, having been adapted into a hollywood film and taught in several schools decades after its publication. although credited with having changed popular perceptions on wolves by portraying them as loving, cooperative and noble, it has been criticized for its idealization of wolves and its factual inaccuracies.[202][203][204] lü jiamin's 2004 semi-autobiographical novel wolf totem uses wolves as symbols of freedom and independence. he associates the mongolian nomads with wolves and compares the han chinese of the present day to sheep, claiming they accept any leadership. as such, the novel has caused controversy with the chinese communist party.[205][206] the wolf is a frequent charge in english heraldry. it is illustrated as a supporter on the shields of lord welby, rendel, and viscount wolseley, and can be found on the coat of arms of lovett and the vast majority of the wilsons and lows. the demi-wolf is a common crest, appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families, including that of the wolfes, whose crest depicts a demi-wolf holding a crown in its paws, in reference to the assistance the family gave to charles ii during the battle of worcester. wolf heads are common in scottish heraldry, particularly in the coats of clan robertson and skene. the wolf is the most common animal in spanish heraldry and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth, or across its back.[207] the wolf is featured on the flags of the confederated tribes of the colville reservation, the oneida nation of wisconsin and the pawnee.[208] the chechen wolf has been a symbol of the chechen nation.[209] in modern times, the wolf is widely used as an emblem for military and paramilitary groups. it is the unofficial symbol of the spetsnaz, and serves as the logo of the turkish gray wolves. during the yugoslav wars, several serb paramilitary units adopted the wolf as their symbol, including the white wolves and the wolves of vučjak.[210] human presence appears to stress wolves, as seen by increased cortisol levels in instances such as snowmobiling near their territory.[211] livestock depredation has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation. as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found.[212] some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programs or state insurance.[213] domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have been bred under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well.[214] wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted.[215] in eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidents are rare in north america, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored.[212] the majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation.[216] the most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (europe), domestic reindeer (northern scandinavia), goats (india), horses (mongolia), cattle and turkeys (north america).[212] the number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus.[217] wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures.[218] a review of the studies on the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.[219][220] competition would favour the wolf, which is known to kill dogs; however wolves usually live in pairs or in small packs in areas with high human persecution, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.[220][221] wolves kill dogs on occasion, and some wolf populations rely on dogs as an important food source. in croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in russia appear to limit stray dog populations. wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in scandinavia and wisconsin.[212][222] the most frequently killed hunting breeds in scandinavia are harriers, older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. large hunting dogs such as swedish elkhounds are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.[222] although the number of dogs killed each year by wolves is relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves' entering villages and farmyards to prey on them. in many cultures, dogs are seen as family members, or at least working team members, and losing one can lead to strong emotional responses such as demanding more liberal hunting regulations.[220] dogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human–wolf conflicts, and are often proposed as one of the non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves.[220][223] shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviours, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. the historical use of shepherd dogs across eurasia has been effective against wolf predation,[220][224] especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock guardian dogs.[220][225] shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.[220] the fear of wolves has been pervasive in many societies, though humans are not part of the wolf's natural prey.[226] how wolves react to humans depends largely on their prior experience with people: wolves lacking any negative experience of humans, or which are food-conditioned, may show little fear of people.[227] although wolves may react aggressively when provoked, such attacks are mostly limited to quick bites on extremities, and the attacks are not pressed.[226] predatory attacks may be preceded by a long period of habituation, in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans. the victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed unless the wolves are driven off. such attacks typically occur only locally and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated. predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the june–august period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock grazing or berry and mushroom picking) increase.[226] cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in belarus, kirov and irkutsk oblasts, karelia and ukraine. also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period.[36] the majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.[226] indian wolves have a history of preying on children, a phenomenon called ""child-lifting"". they may be taken primarily in the summer period in the evening hours, and often within human settlements.[228] cases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in north america, though numerous in the eastern mediterranean, the middle east and central asia. wolves apparently develop the ""furious"" phase of rabies to a very high degree. this, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals.[226] bites from rabid wolves are 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.[229] rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally occur only on a single day. the victims are chosen at random, though most cases involve adult men. during the fifty years up to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in europe and russia, and more than two hundred in southern asia.[226] theodore roosevelt said wolves are difficult to hunt because of their elusiveness, sharp senses, high endurance, and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill a dog.[230] historic methods included killing of spring-born litters in their dens, coursing with dogs (usually combinations of sighthounds, bloodhounds and fox terriers), poisoning with strychnine, and trapping.[231][232] a popular method of wolf hunting in russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with fladry poles carrying a human scent. this method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the odor. some hunters can lure wolves by imitating their calls. in kazakhstan and mongolia, wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practice is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire.[232] several types of dog, including the borzoi and kyrgyz tajgan, have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.[220] wolves and wolf-dog hybrids are sometimes kept as exotic pets. although closely related to domestic dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, being generally less responsive to human commands and more likely to act aggressively. a person is more likely to be fatally mauled by a pet wolf or wolf-dog hybrid than by a dog.[233] "
zebra," †e. capensis e. grevyi †e. koobiforensis †e. mauritanicus †e. oldowayensis e. quagga e. zebra zebras[a] (subgenus hippotigris) are african equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. there are three extant species: the grévy's zebra (equus grevyi), plains zebra (e. quagga) and the mountain zebra (e. zebra). zebras share the genus equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family equidae. zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them as a form of protection from biting flies. zebras inhabit eastern and southern africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands and mountainous areas. zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. they are preyed on mainly by lions and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. in harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras. a zebra's dazzling stripes make them among the most recognisable mammals. they have been featured in art and stories in africa and beyond. historically, they have been highly sought after by exotic animal collectors, but unlike horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated. the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) lists the grévy's zebra as endangered, the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near-threatened. the quagga, a type of plains zebra, was driven to extinction in the 19th century. nevertheless, zebras can be found in numerous protected areas. the english name ""zebra"" dates back to c. 1600, deriving from italian, spanish or portuguese.[1][2] its origins may lay in the latin equiferus meaning ""wild horse""; from equus (""horse"") and ferus (""wild, untamed""). equiferus appears to have entered into portuguese as ezebro or zebro, which was originally a name for a mysterious (possibly feral) equine in the wilds of the iberian peninsula during the middle ages.[3] in ancient times, the zebra was called hippotigris (""horse tiger"") by the greeks and romans.[3][4] the word ""zebra"" was traditionally pronounced with a long initial vowel, but over the course of the 20th century the pronunciation with the short initial vowel became the norm in the uk and the commonwealth.[5] the pronunciation with a long initial vowel remains standard in us english.[6] a group of zebras is referred to as a herd, dazzle, or zeal.[7] zebras are classified in the genus equus (known as equines) along with horses and asses. these three groups are the only living members of the family equidae.[8] the plains zebra and mountain zebra were traditionally placed in the subgenus hippotigris (c. h. smith, 1841) in contrast to the grévy's zebra which was considered the sole species of subgenus dolichohippus (heller, 1912).[9][10][11] groves and bell (2004) placed all three species in the subgenus hippotigris.[12] a 2013 phylogenetic study found that the plains zebra is more closely related to grévy's zebras than mountain zebras.[13] the extinct quagga was originally classified as a distinct species.[14] later genetic studies have placed it as the same species as the plains zebra, either a subspecies or just the southernmost population.[15][16] molecular evidence supports zebras as a monophyletic lineage.[13][17][18] equus originated in north america and direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle pleistocene horse metapodial bone from canada implies a date of 4.07 million years ago (mya) for the most recent common ancestor of the equines within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 mya.[19] horses split from asses and zebras around 4 mya, and equines entered eurasia around 3 mya. zebras and asses diverged from each other close to 2.8 mya and zebra ancestors entered africa around 2.3 mya. the mountain zebra diverged from the other species around 1.75 mya and the plains and grévy's zebra split around 1.5 mya.[13][20][21] the cladogram of equus below is based on vilstrup and colleagues (2013):[13] .mw-parser-output

addition to the three extant species, some fossil zebras have also been identified. equus koobiforensis is an early zebra or equine basal to zebras found in the shungura formation, ethiopia and the olduvai gorge, tanzania, and dated to around 2.3 mya.[21] e. oldowayensis is identified from remains in olduvai gorge dating to 1.8 mya. it is suggested the species was closely related to the grévy's zebra and may have been its ancestor.[33] fossil skulls of e. mauritanicus from algeria which date to around 1 mya appears to show affinities with the plains zebra.[34][35] e. capensis, known as the cape zebra, appeared around 2 mya and lived throughout southern and eastern africa and may also have been a relative of the plains zebra.[36][33] non-african equines that may have been basal to zebras include e. sansaniensis of eurasia (circa 2.5 mya) and e. namadicus (circa 2.5 mya) and e. sivalensis (circa 2.0 mya) of the indian subcontinent.[21] a 2017 mitochondrial dna study placed the eurasian e. ovodovi and the subgenus sussemionus lineage as closer to zebras than to asses.[37] fertile hybrids have been reported in the wild between plains and grévy's zebra.[38] hybridisation has also been recorded between the plains and mountain zebra, though it is possible that these are infertile due to the difference in chromosome numbers between the two species.[39] captive zebras have been bred with horses and donkeys; these are known as zebroids. a zorse is a cross between a zebra and a horse; a zonkey between a zebra and a donkey and a zoni between a zebra and a pony. zebroids are usually infertile and may suffer from dwarfism.[40] as with all wild equines, zebra have barrel-chested bodies with tufted tails, elongated faces and long necks with long, erect manes. their elongated, slender legs end in a single spade-shaped toe covered in a hard hoof. their dentition is adapted for grazing; they have large incisors that clip grass blades and highly crowned, ridged molars well suited for grinding. males have spade-shaped canines, which can be used as weapons in fighting. the eyes of zebras are at the sides and far up the head, which allows them to see above the tall grass while grazing. their moderately long, erect ears are movable and can locate the source of a sound.[8][28][32] unlike horses, zebras and asses have chestnut callosities only on their front limbs. in contrast to other living equines, zebra forelimbs are longer than their back limbs.[32] diagnostic traits of the zebra skull include: its relatively small size with a straight profile, more projected eye sockets, narrower rostrum, reduced postorbital bar, a v-shaped groove separating the metaconid and metastylid of the teeth and both halves of the enamel wall being rounded.[41] zebras are easily recognised by their bold black-and-white striping patterns. the belly and legs are white when unstriped, but the muzzle is dark and the skin underneath the coat is uniformly black.[42][43][44] the general pattern is a dorsal line that extends from the forehead to the tail. from there, the stripes stretch downward except on the rump, where they develop species-specific patterns, and near the nose where they curve toward the nostrils. stripes split above the front legs, creating shoulder stripes. the stripes on the legs, ears and tail are separate and horizontal. zebras also have complex patterns around the eyes and the lower jaw.[42] striping patterns are unique to an individual and heritable.[45] during embryonic development, the stripes appear at eight months, but the patterns may be determined at three to five weeks. for each species there is a point in embryonic development where the stripes are perpendicular to the dorsal and spaced 0.4 mm (0.016 in) apart. however, this happens at three weeks of development for the plains zebra, four weeks for the mountain zebra, and five for grévy's zebra. the difference in timing is thought to be responsible for the differences in the striping patterns of the different species.[42] young or foals are born with brown and white coats, and the brown darkens with age.[26][23] various mutations of the fur have been documented, from mostly white to mostly black.[46] there have even been morphs with white spots on dark backgrounds.[47] albino zebras have been recorded in the forests of mount kenya, with the dark stripes being blonde.[48] the quagga had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs.[49] the function of stripes in zebras has been discussed among biologists since at least the 19th century.[50] popular hypotheses include the following: zebras may travel or migrate to better watered areas.[26][28] plains zebras have been recorded travelling 500 km (310 mi) between namibia and botswana, the longest land migration of mammals in africa.[77] when migrating, they appear to rely on some memory of the locations where foraging conditions were best and may predict conditions months after their arrival.[78] plains zebras are more water-dependent and live in more mesic environments than other species. they seldom wander 10–12 km (6.2–7.5 mi) from a water source.[26][28][79] grévy's zebras can survive almost a week without water but will drink daily when it is plentiful and conserve water well.[80][23] mountain zebras can be found at elevations of up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft).[81] zebras may spend seven hours a day sleeping. during the day, they sleep standing up, while at night they lie down. they regularly rub against trees, rocks, and other objects and roll around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. except for the mountain zebra, other species can roll over completely.[28] zebras eat primarily grasses and sedges but may also consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits, and roots if their favoured foods are scarce. compared to ruminants, zebras have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. nevertheless, they can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. zebras may spend 60–80% of their time feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation.[8][28] the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer, mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialised grazers, which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.[82] zebras are preyed on mainly by lions. leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, brown hyenas and wild dogs pose less of a threat to adults.[83] nile crocodiles also prey on zebras when they near water.[84] biting and kicking are a zebra's defense tactics. when threatened by lions, zebras flee, and when caught they are rarely effective in fighting off the big cats.[85] the zebra can reach a speed of 68.4 km/h (42.5 mph) compared to 57.6 km/h (35.8 mph) for the lion, but maximum acceleration is respectively 18 km/h (11 mph) and 34.2 km/h (21.3 mph). a lion has to surprise a zebra within the first six seconds of breaking cover.[86] however, a 2018 study found that zebras do not escape lions by speed alone but by laterally turning, especially when the predator is close behind.[87] with smaller predators like hyenas and dogs, zebras may act more aggressively, especially in defense of their young.[88] zebra species have two basic social structures. plains and mountain zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one stallion, several mares, and their offspring. these groups have their own home ranges, which overlap, and they tend to be nomadic. stallions form and expand their harems by recruiting young mares from their natal (birth) harems. the stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. plains zebra groups also live in a fission–fusion society. they gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. among harem-holding species, this behaviour has otherwise only been observed in primates such as the gelada and the hamadryas baboon.[8][28][89] females of these species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, and protection from predators and harassment by outside males. among females in a harem, a linear dominance hierarchy exists based on the time at which they join the group. harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next-highest ranking mare and her offspring, and so on. the family stallion takes up the rear. young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually herded by outside males to be included as permanent members of their harems.[8][28][89] in the more arid-living grévy's zebras, adults have more fluid associations and adult males establish large territories, marked by dung piles, and monopolise the females that enter them. this species lives in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with nonlactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. the most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. mares may wander through several territories but remain in one when they have young. staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource.[8][28][89] in all species, excess males gather in bachelor groups. these are typically young males that are not yet ready to establish a harem or territory.[8][28][89] with the plains zebra, the males in a bachelor group have strong bonds and have a linear dominance hierarchy.[28] bachelor groups tend to be at the periphery of herds and when the herd moves, the bachelors trail behind.[79] mountain zebra bachelor groups may also include young females that have recently left their natal group, as well as old males they have lost their harems. a territorial grévy's zebra stallion may tolerate non-territorial bachelors who wander in their territory, however when a mare in oestrous is present the territorial stallion keeps other stallions at bay. bachelors prepare for their adult roles with play fights and greeting/challenge rituals, which make up most of their activities.[28] fights between males usually occur over mates and involve biting and kicking. in plains zebra, stallions fight each other over recently matured mares to bring into their group and her family stallion will fight off other males trying to abduct her. as long as a harem stallion is healthy, he is not usually challenged. only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then, the new stallion gradually takes over, pushing the old one out without a fight. agonistic behaviour between male grévy's zebras occurs at the border of their territories.[28] when meeting for the first time, or after they have separated, individuals may greet each other by rubbing and sniffing their noses followed by rubbing their cheeks, moving their noses along their bodies and sniffing each other's genitals. they then may rub and press their shoulders against each other and rest their heads on one another. this greeting is usually performed among harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing.[28] plains and mountain zebras strengthen their social bonds with grooming. members of a harem nip and scrape along the neck, withers, and back with their teeth and lips. grooming usually occurs between mothers and foals and between stallions and mares. grooming shows social status and eases aggressive behaviour.[28][90] although grévy's zebras do not perform social grooming, they do sometimes rub against another individual.[23] zebras produce a number of vocalisations and noises. the plains zebra has a distinctive, high-pitched contact call (commonly called ""barking"") heard as ""a-ha, a-ha, a-ha"" or ""kwa-ha, kaw-ha, ha, ha"".[26] the call of the grévy's zebra has been described as ""something like a hippo's grunt combined with a donkey's wheeze"", while the mountain zebra is relatively silent. loud snorting in zebras is associated with alarm. squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors also squeal while play fighting. zebras also communicate with visual displays, and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. visual displays also incorporate the positions of the head, ears, and tail. a zebra may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. flattened ears, bared teeth, and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.[28] among plains and mountain zebras, the adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while in grévy's zebras, mating is more promiscuous and the males have larger testes for sperm competition.[8][91] oestrus in female zebras lasts five to ten days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing mucus, and swollen, everted (inside out) labia. in addition, females in oestrous will stand with their hind legs spread and raise their tails when in the presence of a male. males assess the female's reproductive state with a curled lip and bared teeth (flehmen response) and the female will solicit mating by backing in. the length of gestation varies by species; it is roughly 11–13 months, and most mares come into oestrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions.[28] in harem-holding species, oestrus in a female becomes less noticeable to outside males as she gets older, hence competition for older females is virtually nonexistent.[26] usually, a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour of birth.[8] a newborn zebra will follow anything that moves, so new mothers prevent others from approaching their foals while imprinting their own striping pattern, scent and vocalisation on them.[23] within a few weeks, foals attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for eight to thirteen months.[8] living in an arid environment, grévy's zebras have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.[92] in plains and mountain zebras, foals are cared for mostly by their mothers, but if threatened by pack-hunting hyenas and dogs, the entire group works together to protect all the young. the group forms a protective front with the foals in the centre, and the stallion will rush at predators that come too close.[28] in grévy's zebras, mothers may gather into small groups and leave their young in ""kindergartens"" guarded by a territorial male while searching for water.[92] a stallion may look after a foal in his territory to ensure that the mother stays, though it may not be his.[89] by contrast, plains zebra stallions are generally intolerant of foals that are not theirs and may practice infanticide and feticide via violence to the pregnant mare.[93] with their distinctive black-and-white stripes, zebras are among the most recognisable mammals. they have been associated with beauty and grace, with naturalist thomas pennant describing them in 1781 as ""the most elegant of quadrupeds"". zebras have been popular in photography, with some wildlife photographers describing them as the most photogenic animal. zebras have become staples in children's stories and wildlife-themed art, such as depictions of noah's ark. they are known for being among the last animals to be featured in the dictionary and in children's alphabet books where they are often used to represent the letter 'z'.[94] zebra stripes are also popularly used for body paintings, dress, furniture and architecture.[95] zebras have been featured in african art and culture for millennia. they are depicted in rock art in southern africa dating from 28,000 to 20,000 years ago, though not as commonly as antelope species like eland. how the zebra got its stripes has been the subject of folk tales, some of which involve it being scorched by fire. the maasai proverb ""a man without culture is like a zebra without stripes"" has become popular in africa and beyond. the san people associated zebra stripes with water, rain and lighting because of its dazzling pattern, and water spirits were conceived of having zebra stripes.[96] for the shona people, the zebra is a totem animal and is praised in a poem as an ""iridescent and glittering creature"". its stripes have symbolised the joining of male and female and at the ruined city of great zimbabwe, zebra stripes decorate what is believed to be a domba, a premarital school meant to initiate girls into adulthood. in the shona language, the name madhuve means ""woman/women of the zebra totem"" and is a given name for girls in zimbabwe. the plains zebra is the national animal of botswana and zebras have been depicted on stamps during colonial and post-colonial africa. for people of the african diaspora, the zebra represented the politics of race and identity, being both black and white.[97] in cultures outside of its range, the zebra has been thought of as a more exotic alternative to the horse; the comic book character sheena, queen of the jungle, is depicted riding a zebra and explorer osa johnson was photographed riding one.[98] the film racing stripes features a captive zebra ostracised from the horses and ending up being ridden by a rebellious girl.[99] zebras have been featured as characters in animated films like khumba, the lion king and the madagascar films and television series such as zou.[100] zebras have been popular subjects for paintings, particularly for abstract, modernist and surrealist artists. notable zebra art includes christopher wood's zebra and parachute, lucian freud's the painter's room and quince on a blue table and the various paintings of mary fedden and sidney nolan. victor vasarely depicted zebras as mere bands of black and white and joined together in a jigsaw puzzle fashion. carel weight's escape of the zebra from the zoo during an air raid was based on a real life incident of a zebra escaping during the bombing of london zoo and consists of four panels like a comic book.[101] zebras have lent themselves to products and advertisements, notably for 'zebra grate polish' cleaning supplies by british manufacturer reckitt and sons and japanese pen manufacturer zebra co., ltd..[102] zebras have been kept in captivity since at least the roman empire.[103] in later times, captive zebras have been shipped around the world, often for diplomatic reasons. in 1261, sultan baibars of egypt established an embassy with alfonso x of castile and sent a zebra and other exotic animals as gifts. in 1417, a zebra was sent to the yongle emperor of china from somalia as a gift for the chinese people. the fourth mughal emperor jahangir received a zebra via ethiopia in 1620 and commissioned a painting of the animal, which was completed by ustad mansur. in the 1670s, ethiopian emperor yohannes i exported two zebras to the dutch governor of jakarta. these animals would eventually be given by the dutch to the tokugawa shogunate of japan.[104] when queen charlotte received a zebra as a wedding gift in 1762, the animal became a source of fascination for the people of britain. many flocked to see it at its paddock at buckingham palace. it soon became the subject of humour and satire, being referred to as ""the queen's ass"", and was the subject of an oil painting by george stubbs in 1763. the zebra also gained a reputation for being ill-tempered and kicked at visitors.[105] in 1882, ethiopia sent a zebra to french president jules grévy, and the species it belonged to was named in his honour.[9] attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful. it is possible that having evolved under pressure from the many large predators of africa, including early humans, they became more aggressive, thus making domestication more difficult.[106] however, zebras have been trained and tamed throughout history. in rome, zebras are recorded to have pulled chariots during gladiator games starting in the reign of caracalla (198 to 217 ad).[107] in the late 19th century, the zoologist walter rothschild trained some zebras to draw a carriage in england, which he drove to buckingham palace to demonstrate the tame character of zebras to the public. however, he did not ride on them as he realised that they were too small and aggressive.[108] in the early 20th century, german colonial officers in german east africa tried to use zebras for both driving and riding, with limited success.[109] as of 2016–2019, the iucn red list of mammals lists the grévy's zebra as endangered, the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near-threatened. grévy's zebra populations are estimated at less than 2,000 mature individuals, but they are stable. mountain zebras number near 35,000 individuals and their population appears to be increasing. plains zebra are estimated to number 150,000–250,000 with a decreasing population trend. human intervention has fragmented zebra ranges and populations. zebras are threatened by hunting for their hide and meat, and habitat change from farming. they also compete with livestock for food and water and fencing blocks their migration routes.[110][111][112] civil wars in some countries have also caused declines in zebra populations.[113] by the beginning of the 20th century, zebra skins were valued commodities and were typically used as rugs. in the 21st century, zebra hides still sell for $1,000 and $2,000, and they are taken by trophy hunters.[114] zebra meat was mainly eaten by european colonisers; among african cultures only the san are known to eat it regularly.[115] the quagga population was hunted by early dutch settlers and later by afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. the skins were traded or used locally. the quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. the last known wild quagga died in 1878.[116] the last captive quagga, a female in amsterdam's natura artis magistra zoo, lived there from 9 may 1867 until it died on 12 august 1883.[117] the cape mountain zebra, a subspecies of mountain zebra, was driven to near extinction by hunting and habitat loss with less than 50 individuals by the 1950s. conservation efforts by the south african national parks have since allowed the populations to grow to over 2,600 by the 2010s.[118] zebras can be found in numerous protected areas. important areas for the grévy's zebra include yabelo wildlife sanctuary and chelbi sanctuary in ethiopia and buffalo springs, samburu and shaba national reserves in kenya.[110] protected areas for the plains zebra include the serengeti national park in tanzania, tsavo and masai mara in kenya, hwange national park in zimbabwe, etosha national park in namibia, and kruger national park in south africa.[112] mountain zebras are protected in mountain zebra national park, karoo national park and goegap nature reserve in south africa as well as etosha and namib-naukluft park in namibia.[111][119] the quagga project an organisation that selectively breeds zebras to recreate the hair coat pattern of the quagga "
child," biologically, a child (plural children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty,[1][2] or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty.[3] the legal definition of child generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority.[1] children generally have fewer rights and less responsibility than adults. they are classed as unable to make serious decisions, and legally must be under the care of their parents or another responsible caregiver. child may also describe a relationship with a parent (such as sons and daughters of any age)[4] or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in ""a child of nature"" or ""a child of the sixties"".[5] biologically, a child is a person between birth and puberty,[1][2] or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty.[3] legally, the term child may refer to anyone below the age of majority or some other age limit. the united nations convention on the rights of the child defines child as ""a human being below the age of 18 years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier"".[6] this is ratified by 192 of 194 member countries. the term child may also refer to someone below another legally defined age limit unconnected to the age of majority. in singapore, for example, a child is legally defined as someone under the age of 14 under the ""children and young persons act"" whereas the age of majority is 21.[7][8] in u.s. immigration law, a child refers to anyone who is under the age of 21.[9] some english definitions of the word child include the fetus (sometimes termed the unborn).[10] in many cultures, a child is considered an adult after undergoing a rite of passage, which may or may not correspond to the time of puberty. children generally have fewer rights than adults and are classed as unable to make serious decisions, and legally must always be under the care of a responsible adult or child custody, whether their parents divorce or not. recognition of childhood as a state different from adulthood began to emerge in the 16th and 17th centuries. society began to relate to the child not as a miniature adult but as a person of a lower level of maturity needing adult protection, love and nurturing. this change can be traced in paintings: in the middle ages, children were portrayed in art as miniature adults with no childlike characteristics. in the 16th century, images of children began to acquire a distinct childlike appearance. from the late 17th century onwards, children were shown playing with toys and later literature for children also began to develop at this time.[11] according to professor peter jones of cambridge university development of the brain continues long past legal definitions of adulthood so ""to have a definition of when you move from childhood to adulthood looks increasingly absurd. it's a much more nuanced transition that takes place over three decades.""[12] children go through stages of social development. children learn initially through play and later in most societies through formal schooling. as a child is growing they are learning how to do some tasks in chronological order. they learn how to prioritize their goals and actions. their behavior is transcending as they learn new perspectives from other people. they learn how to represent certain things symbolically and learn new behavior.[13] children with adhd and learning disabilities may need extra help to develop social skills. the impulsive characteristics of an adhd child may lead to poor peer relationships. children with poor attention spans may not tune into social cues in their environment, making it difficult for them to learn social skills through experience.[14] health issues affecting children are generally managed separately from those affecting adults, by pediatricians. the age at which children are considered responsible for their society-bound actions (e. g. marriage, voting, etc.) has also changed over time, and this is reflected in the way they are treated in courts of law. in roman times, children were regarded as not culpable for crimes, a position later adopted by the church. in the 19th century, children younger than seven years old were believed incapable of crime. children from the age of seven forward were considered responsible for their actions. therefore, they could face criminal charges, be sent to adult prison, and be punished like adults by whipping, branding or hanging. however, courts at the time would consider the offender's age when deliberating sentencing.[15] minimum employment age and marriage age also vary. the age limit of voluntary/involuntary military service is also disputed at the international level.[16] during the early 17th century in england, about two-thirds of all children died before the age of four.[18] during the industrial revolution, the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.[19] this has continued in england, and in the 21st century child mortality rates have fallen across the world. about 12.6 million under-five infants died worldwide in 1990, which declined to 6.6 million in 2012. the infant mortality rate dropped from 90 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990, to 48 in 2012. the highest average infant mortality rates are in sub-saharan africa, at 98 deaths per 1,000 live births – over double the world's average.[17] education, in the general sense, refers to the act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and preparing intellectually for mature life.[20] formal education most often takes place through schooling. a right to education has been recognized by some governments. at the global level, article 13 of the united nations' 1966 international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights recognizes the right of everyone to an education.[21] education is compulsory in most places up to a certain age, but attendance at school may not be, with alternative options such as home-schooling or e-learning being recognized as valid forms of education in certain jurisdictions. children in some countries (especially in parts of africa and asia) are often kept out of school, or attend only for short periods. data from unicef indicate that in 2011, 57 million children were out of school; and more than 20% of african children have never attended primary school or have left without completing primary education.[22] according to a un report, warfare is preventing 28 million children worldwide from receiving an education, due to the risk of sexual violence and attacks in schools.[23] other factors that keep children out of school include poverty, child labor, social attitudes, and long distances to school.[24][25] social attitudes toward children differ around the world in various cultures and change over time. a 1988 study on european attitudes toward the centrality of children found that italy was more child-centric and the netherlands less child-centric, with other countries, such as austria, great britain, ireland and west germany falling in between.[26] in 2013, child marriage rates of female children under the age of 18 reached 75% in niger, 68% in central african republic and chad, 66% in bangladesh, and 47% in india.[27] according to a 2019 unicef report on child marriage, 37% of females were married before the age of 18 in sub-saharan africa, followed by south asia at 30%. lower levels were found in latin america and caribbean (25%), the middle east and north africa (18%), and eastern europe and central asia (11%), while rates in western europe and north america were minimal.[28] child marriage is more prevalent with girls, but also involves boys. a 2018 study in the journal vulnerable children and youth studies found that, worldwide, 4.5% of males are married before age 18, with the central african republic having the highest average rate at 27.9%.[29] protection of children from abuse is considered an important contemporary goal. this includes protecting children from exploitation such as child labor, child trafficking and child selling, child sexual abuse, including child prostitution and child pornography, military use of children, and child laundering in illegal adoptions. there exist several international instruments for these purposes, such as: emergencies and conflicts pose detrimental risks to the health, safety, and well-being of children. there are many different kinds of conflicts and emergencies, e.g. wars and natural disasters. as of 2010 approximately 13 million children are displaced by armed conflicts and violence around the world.[30] where violent conflicts are the norm, the lives of young children are significantly disrupted and their families have great difficulty in offering the sensitive and consistent care that young children need for their healthy development.[30] studies on the effect of emergencies and conflict on the physical and mental health of children between birth and 8 years old show that where the disaster is natural, the rate of ptsd occurs in anywhere from 3 to 87 percent of affected children.[31] however, rates of ptsd for children living in chronic conflict conditions varies from 15 to 50 percent.[32][33] "
woman," a woman is an adult female human.[1][2] the term woman may also refer to a girl (a female child or adolescent). the plural women is sometimes used for female humans regardless of age, as in phrases such as ""women's rights."" typically, a woman has two x chromosomes and is capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause. female anatomy, as distinguished from male anatomy, includes the fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, vulva, breasts, skene's glands, and bartholin's glands. the adult female pelvis is wider than the male's, the hips are generally broader, and women have significantly less facial and other body hair. on average, women are shorter and less muscular than men. throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined and limited women's activities and opportunities; many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for women. with restrictions loosening during the 20th century in many societies, women have gained access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker, and the ability to pursue higher education. violence against women, whether within families or in communities, has a long history and is primarily committed by men. some women are denied reproductive rights. the movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality. trans women have a male sex assignment at birth that does not align with their gender identity,[3] while intersex women were born with sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of female biology. the spelling of ""woman"" in english has progressed over the past millennium from wīfmann[4] to wīmmann to wumman, and finally, the modern spelling woman.[5] in old english, wīfmann meant ""woman"" (literally ""woman-person""), whereas wer meant ""man"". mann had a gender-neutral meaning of ""human"", corresponding to modern english ""person"" or ""someone""; however, subsequent to the norman conquest, man began to be used more in reference to ""male human"", and by the late 13th century had begun to eclipse usage of the older term wer.[6] the medial labial consonants f and m in wīfmann coalesced into the modern form ""woman"", while the initial element wīf, which had also meant ""woman"", underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman (""wife""). it is a popular misconception that the term ""woman"" is etymologically connected to ""womb"".[7] ""womb"" derives from the old english word wamb meaning ""belly, uterus""[8] (modern german retains the colloquial term ""wamme"" from old high german wamba for ""belly, paunch, lap"").[9][10] womanhood is the period in a human female's life after she has passed through childhood, puberty, and adolescence.[11] different countries have different laws, but age 18 is frequently considered the age of majority (the age at which a person is legally considered an adult). the word woman can be used generally, to mean any female human, or specifically, to mean an adult female human as contrasted with girl. the word girl originally meant ""young person of either sex"" in english;[12] it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a female child.[13] the term girl is sometimes used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman; however, during the early 1970s, feminists challenged such use because the use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offence. in particular, previously common terms such as office girl are no longer widely used. conversely, in certain cultures which link family honor with female virginity, the word girl (or its equivalent in other languages) is still used to refer to a never-married woman; in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the more-or-less obsolete english maid or maiden. there are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman. the term ""womanhood"" merely means the state of being a woman, having passed the menarche; ""femininity"" is used to refer to a set of typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to gender roles; ""womanliness"" is like ""femininity"", but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles. ""distaff"" is an archaic adjective derived from women's conventional role as a spinner, now used only as a deliberate archaism. menarche, the onset of menstruation, occurs on average at age 12–13. many cultures have rites of passage to symbolize a girl's coming of age, such as confirmation in some branches of christianity,[14] bat mitzvah in judaism, or a custom of a special celebration for a certain birthday (generally between 12 and 21), like the quinceañera of latin america. trans women have a male sex assignment at birth that does not align with their gender identity,[3] while intersex women were born with sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of female biology. the earliest women whose names are known through archaeology include: in terms of biology, the female sex organs are involved in the reproductive system, whereas the secondary sex characteristics are involved in breastfeeding children and attracting a mate.[29][30] the ovaries, in addition to their regulatory function of producing hormones, produce female gametes called eggs which, when fertilized by male gametes (sperm), form new genetic individuals. the uterus is an organ with tissue to protect and nurture the developing fetus and muscle to expel it when giving birth. the vagina is used in copulation and birthing, although the term vagina is often colloquially and incorrectly used in the english language for the vulva (or external female genitalia),[31][32] which consists of (in addition to the vaginal opening) the labia, the clitoris, and the female urethra. the breasts evolved from the sweat glands to produce milk, a nutritious secretion that is the most distinctive characteristic of mammals, along with live birth. in mature women the breast is generally more prominent than in most other mammals; this prominence, not necessary for milk production, is thought to be at least partially the result of sexual selection.[30] normally cells from females contain two x chromosomes, and cells from males contain an x and a y chromosome.[33] during early fetal development embryos of both sexes appear gender-neutral until about week 7. at that time if the fetus has received a y chromosome from the father it usually develops into a male, an effect of being exposed to testosterone. if the fetus receives an x chromosome from the father it develops into a female, an effect of being exposed to estrogen. in about one in a thousand births, a female is born with three x chromosomes, a condition termed triple x syndrome.[34] because humans inherit mitochondrial dna only from the mother's ovum, genealogical researchers can trace maternal lineage far back in time. whether or not a child is considered female does not always determine whether or not the child will later identify themselves that way (see gender identity). for instance, intersex individuals, who have mixed physical and/or genetic features, may use other criteria in determining their gender identities.[35] although fewer females than males are born (the ratio is around 1:1.05), newborn girls are more likely to reach their first birthday than are boys and women typically have a longer life expectancy of six to eight years, although in some areas gender-based discrimination against women has lowered female life expectancy to lower or equal to that of males. out of the total human population in 2015, there were 101.8 men for every 100 women. the life expectancy differences are partly due to inherent biological advantages, but they also reflect behavioral differences between men and women. the gap is narrowing to some extent in some developed countries, possibly due to increased smoking among women and declining rates of cardiovascular disease among men. the world health organization writes that it is ""important to note that the extra years of life for women are not always lived in good health.""[36][37][38] until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls consists of the differences in their genitalia. puberty is the process of physical changes by which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction to enable fertilization. it usually takes place between the ages 10 – 16. it is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads - either the ovaries or the testes. in response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sexual organs. physical growth—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body. the major landmark of girls' puberty is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12–13.[39][40][41][42] most girls go through menarche and are then able to become pregnant and bear children. this generally requires internal fertilization of her eggs with the sperm of a man through sexual intercourse, though artificial insemination or the surgical implantation of an existing embryo is also possible (see reproductive technology). there are some diseases that primarily affect women, such as lupus. also, there are some sex-related illnesses that are found more frequently or exclusively in women, e.g., breast cancer, cervical cancer, or ovarian cancer. women and men may have different symptoms of an illness and may also respond to medical treatment differently. this area of medical research is studied by gender-based medicine.[43] the study of female reproduction and reproductive organs is called gynaecology.[44] the issue of women's health has been taken up by many feminists, especially where reproductive health is concerned. women's health is positioned within a wider body of knowledge cited by, amongst others, the world health organization, which places importance on gender as a social determinant of health.[45] maternal mortality or maternal death is defined by who as ""the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.""[46] in 2008, noting that each year more than 100,000 women die of complications of pregnancy and childbirth and at least seven million experience serious health problems while 50 million more have adverse health consequences after childbirth, the world health organization urged midwife training to strengthen maternal and newborn health services. to support the upgrading of midwifery skills the who established a midwife training program, action for safe motherhood.[47] about 99% of maternal deaths occur in developing countries. more than half of them occur in sub-saharan africa and almost one third in south asia. the main causes of maternal mortality include pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, unsafe abortion, pregnancy complications from malaria and hiv/aids, and severe bleeding and infections following childbirth.[48] most european countries, australia, japan, and singapore are very safe in regard to childbirth.[49] in 1990 the us ranked 12th of the 14 developed countries that were analyzed and since that time the death rates of every country have steadily improved while the us rate has spiked dramatically. while the others that were analyzed in 1990 show a 2017 death rate of fewer than 10 deaths per every 100,000 live births, the u.s. rate rose to 26.4. furthermore, for every one of the 700 to 900 women who die in the u.s. each year during pregnancy or childbirth, 70 experience significant complications, totaling more than one percent of all births.[50][51] reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health. the international federation of gynecology and obstetrics has stated that:[52] the world health organization reports that based on data from 2010–2014, 56 million induced abortions occurred worldwide each year (25% of all pregnancies). of those, about 25 million were considered as unsafe. the who reports that in developed regions about 30 women die for every 100 000 unsafe abortions and that number rises to 220 deaths per 100 000 unsafe abortions in developing regions and 520 deaths per 100 000 unsafe abortions in sub-saharan africa. the who ascribes these unnecessary deaths to in recent history, gender roles have changed greatly. at some earlier points in history, children's occupational aspirations starting at a young age differed according to gender.[54] traditionally, middle class women were involved in domestic tasks emphasizing child care. for poorer women, especially working class women, although this often remained an ideal,[specify] economic necessity compelled them to seek employment outside the home. many of the occupations that were available to them were lower in pay than those available to men.[citation needed] as changes in the labor market for women came about, availability of employment changed from only ""dirty"", long hour factory jobs to ""cleaner"", more respectable office jobs where more education was demanded. women's participation in the u.s. labor force rose from 6% in 1900 to 23% in 1923. these shifts in the labor force led to changes in the attitudes of women at work, allowing for the revolution which resulted in women becoming career and education oriented.[citation needed] in the 1970s, many female academics, including scientists, avoided having children. throughout the 1980s, institutions tried to equalize conditions for men and women in the workplace. even so, the inequalities at home hampered women's opportunities: professional women were still generally considered responsible for domestic labor and child care, which limited the time and energy they could devote to their careers. until the early 20th century, u.s. women's colleges required their women faculty members to remain single, on the grounds that a woman could not carry on two full-time professions at once. according to schiebinger, ""being a scientist and a wife and a mother is a burden in society that expects women more often than men to put family ahead of career."" (p. 93).[55] movements advocate equality of opportunity for both sexes and equal rights irrespective of gender. through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement, in recent decades women in many societies have gained access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker. despite these advances, modern women in western society still face challenges in the workplace as well as with the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and motherhood, and others. sexism can be a main concern and barrier for women almost anywhere, though its forms, perception, and gravity vary between societies and social classes. there has been an increase in the endorsement of egalitarian gender roles in the home by both women and men.[56][failed verification] although a greater number of women are seeking higher education, their salaries are often less than those of men. cbs news said in 2005 that in the united states women who are ages 30 to 44 and hold a university degree make 62 percent of what similarly qualified men do, a lower rate than in all but three of the 19 countries for which numbers are available. some western nations with greater inequity in pay are germany, new zealand and switzerland.[57] the un declaration on the elimination of violence against women defines ""violence against women"" as:[58] any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. and identifies three forms of such violence: that which occurs in the family, that which occurs within the general community, and that which is perpetrated or condoned by the state. it also states that ""violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women"".[59] violence against women remains a widespread problem, fueled, especially outside the west, by patriarchal social values, lack of adequate laws, and lack of enforcement of existing laws. social norms that exist in many parts of the world hinder progress towards protecting women from violence. for example, according to surveys by unicef, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in afghanistan and jordan, 87% in mali, 86% in guinea and timor-leste, 81% in laos, and 80% in the central african republic.[60] a 2010 survey conducted by the pew research center found that stoning as a punishment for adultery was supported by 82% of respondents in egypt and pakistan, 70% in jordan, 56% nigeria, and 42% in indonesia.[61] specific forms of violence that affect women include female genital mutilation, sex trafficking, forced prostitution, forced marriage, rape, sexual harassment, honor killings, acid throwing, and dowry related violence. governments can be complicit in violence against women, for instance through practices such as stoning (as punishment for adultery). there have also been many forms of violence against women which have been prevalent historically, notably the burning of witches, the sacrifice of widows (such as sati) and foot binding. the prosecution of women accused of witchcraft has a long tradition; for example, during the early modern period (between the 15th and 18th centuries), witch trials were common in europe and in the european colonies in north america. today, there remain regions of the world (such as parts of sub-saharan africa, rural north india, and papua new guinea) where belief in witchcraft is held by many people, and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence.[62][63][64] in addition, there are also countries which have criminal legislation against the practice of witchcraft. in saudi arabia, witchcraft remains a crime punishable by death, and in 2011 the country beheaded a woman for 'witchcraft and sorcery'.[65][66] it is also the case that certain forms of violence against women have been recognized as criminal offenses only during recent decades, and are not universally prohibited, in that many countries continue to allow them. this is especially the case with marital rape.[67][68] in the western world, there has been a trend towards ensuring gender equality within marriage and prosecuting domestic violence, but in many parts of the world women still lose significant legal rights when entering a marriage.[69] sexual violence against women greatly increases during times of war and armed conflict, during military occupation, or ethnic conflicts; most often in the form of war rape and sexual slavery. contemporary examples of sexual violence during war include rape during the armenian genocide, rape during the bangladesh liberation war, rape in the bosnian war, rape during the rwandan genocide, and rape during second congo war. in colombia, the armed conflict has also resulted in increased sexual violence against women.[70] the most recent case was the sexual jihad done by isil where 5000–7000 yazidi and christian girls and children were sold into sexual slavery during the genocide and rape of yazidi and christian women, some of which jumped to their death from mount sinjar, as described in a witness statement.[71] laws and policies on violence against women vary by jurisdiction. in the european union, sexual harassment and human trafficking are subject to directives.[72][73] women in different parts of the world dress in different ways, with their choices of clothing being influenced by local culture, religious tenets, traditions, social norms, and fashion trends, amongst other factors. different societies have different ideas about modesty. however, in many jurisdictions, women's choices in regard to dress are not always free, with laws limiting what they may or may not wear. this is especially the case in regard to islamic dress. while certain jurisdictions legally mandate such clothing (the wearing of the headscarf), other countries forbid or restrict the wearing of certain hijab attire (such as burqa/covering the face) in public places (one such country is france – see french ban on face covering). these laws are highly controversial.[74] the total fertility rate (tfr) – the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime — differs significantly between different regions of the world. in 2016, the highest estimated tfr was in niger (6.62 children born per woman) and the lowest in singapore (0.82 children/woman).[76] while most sub-saharan african countries have a high tfr, which creates problems due to lack of resources and contributes to overpopulation, most western countries currently experience a sub replacement fertility rate which may lead to population ageing and population decline. in many parts of the world, there has been a change in family structure over the past few decades. for instance, in the west, there has been a trend of moving away from living arrangements that include the extended family to those which only consist of the nuclear family. there has also been a trend to move from marital fertility to non-marital fertility. children born outside marriage may be born to cohabiting couples or to single women. while births outside marriage are common and fully accepted in some parts of the world, in other places they are highly stigmatized, with unmarried mothers facing ostracism, including violence from family members, and in extreme cases even honor killings.[77][78] in addition, sex outside marriage remains illegal in many countries (such as saudi arabia, pakistan,[79] afghanistan,[80][81] iran,[81] kuwait,[82] maldives,[83] morocco,[84] oman,[85] mauritania,[86] united arab emirates,[87][88] sudan,[89] and yemen[90]). the social role of the mother differs between cultures. in many parts of the world, women with dependent children are expected to stay at home and dedicate all their energy to child raising, while in other places mothers most often return to paid work (see working mother and stay-at-home mother). particular religious doctrines have specific stipulations relating to gender roles, social and private interaction between the sexes, appropriate dressing attire for women, and various other issues affecting women and their position in society. in many countries, these religious teachings influence the criminal law, or the family law of those jurisdictions (see sharia law, for example). the relation between religion, law and gender equality has been discussed by international organizations.[91] single-sex education has traditionally been dominant and is still highly relevant. universal education, meaning state-provided primary and secondary education independent of gender, is not yet a global norm, even if it is assumed in most developed countries. in some western countries, women have surpassed men at many levels of education. for example, in the united states in 2005/2006, women earned 62% of associate degrees, 58% of bachelor's degrees, 60% of master's degrees, and 50% of doctorates.[92][93] the educational gender gap in organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) countries has been reduced over the last 30 years. younger women today are far more likely to have completed a tertiary qualification: in 19 of the 30 oecd countries, more than twice as many women aged 25 to 34 have completed tertiary education than have women aged 55 to 64. in 21 of 27 oecd countries with comparable data, the number of women graduating from university-level programmes is equal to or exceeds that of men. 15-year-old girls tend to show much higher expectations for their careers than boys of the same age.[94] while women account for more than half of university graduates in several oecd countries, they receive only 30% of tertiary degrees granted in science and engineering fields, and women account for only 25% to 35% of researchers in most oecd countries.[95] research shows that while women are studying at prestigious universities at the same rate as men they are not being given the same chance to join the faculty. sociologist harriet zuckerman has observed that the more prestigious an institute is, the more difficult and time-consuming it will be for women to obtain a faculty position there. in 1989, harvard university tenured its first woman in chemistry, cynthia friend, and in 1992 its first woman in physics, melissa franklin. she also observed that women were more likely to hold their first professional positions as instructors and lecturers while men are more likely to work first in tenure positions. according to smith and tang, as of 1989, 65 percent of men and only 40 percent of women held tenured positions and only 29 percent of all scientists and engineers employed as assistant professors in four-year colleges and universities were women.[96] in 1992, women earned 9 percent of the phds awarded in engineering, but only one percent of those women became professors. in 1995, 11 percent of professors in science and engineering were women. in relation, only 311 deans of engineering schools were women, which is less than 1 percent of the total. even in psychology, a degree in which women earn the majority of phds, they hold a significant amount of fewer tenured positions, roughly 19 percent in 1994.[97] world literacy is lower for females than for males. the cia world factbook presents an estimate from 2010 which shows that 80% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over). literacy rates are lowest in south and west asia, and in parts of sub-saharan africa.[98] women are underrepresented in government in most countries. in january 2019, the global average of women in national assemblies was 24.3%.[100] suffrage is the civil right to vote. women's suffrage in the united states was achieved gradually, first at state and local levels, starting in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and in 1920 women in the us received universal suffrage, with the passage of the nineteenth amendment to the united states constitution. some western countries were slow to allow women to vote, notably switzerland, where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971, and in the canton of appenzell innerrhoden women were granted the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the federal supreme court of switzerland;[101][102] and liechtenstein, in 1984, through a women's suffrage referendum. women have, throughout history, made contributions to science, literature and art. one area where women have been permitted most access historically was that of obstetrics and gynecology (prior to the 18th century, caring for pregnant women in europe was undertaken by women; from the mid 18th century onwards, medical monitoring of pregnant women started to require rigorous formal education, to which women did not generally have access, and thus the practice was largely transferred to men).[103][104] writing was generally also considered acceptable for upper-class women, although achieving success as a female writer in a male-dominated world could be very difficult; as a result of several women writers adopted a male pen name (e.g. george sand, george eliot).[citation needed] women have been composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions. there are music movements,[clarification needed] events and genres related to women, women's issues and feminism.[citation needed] in the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of popular music and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, rock critics and rock instrumentalists. although there have been a huge number of women composers in classical music, from the medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the commonly performed classical music repertoire, music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the concise oxford history of music, clara schumann is one of the only female composers who is mentioned. women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. a 2015 article on concerto soloists in major canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the orchestre symphonique de montreal were men. in 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked vienna philharmonic orchestra. women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and heavy metal, although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and all-female bands. women are particularly underrepresented in extreme metal genres.[105] women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, music producing, and sound engineering. while women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women musicologists, women became involved in music education ""... to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.""[106] according to jessica duchen, a music writer for london's the independent, women musicians in classical music are ""... too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent"" and they face pressure ""... to look sexy onstage and in photos.""[107] duchen states that while ""[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks, ... the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.""[107] according to the uk's radio 3 editor, edwina wolstencroft, the classical music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra.[108] in popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.[109] the glyph (♀) for the planet and roman goddess venus, or aphrodite in greek, is the symbol used in biology for the female sex.[110][111][112] in ancient alchemy, the venus symbol stood for copper and was associated with femininity.[112] medical: dynamics: sociological: "
human," humans (homo sapiens) are a species of highly intelligent primates. they are the only extant members of the subtribe hominina and—together with chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans—are part of the family hominidae (the great apes, or hominids). humans are terrestrial animals, characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; larger, more complex brains than other primates; and highly advanced and organized societies.[3][4] several early hominins used fire and occupied much of eurasia. early modern humans are thought to have diverged in africa from an earlier hominin around 300,000 years ago, with the earliest fossil evidence of homo sapiens also appearing around 300,000 years ago in africa.[5] humans began to exhibit evidence of behavioral modernity at least by about 100,000–70,000 years ago (and possibly earlier).[6][7][8][9][10] in several waves of migration, h. sapiens ventured out of africa and populated most of the world.[11][12] the spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected the biosphere and millions of species worldwide. among the key advantages that explain this evolutionary success is the presence of a larger, well-developed brain, which enables advanced abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning. humans use tools more frequently and effectively than any other animal: they are the only extant species to build fires, cook food, clothe themselves, and create and use numerous other technologies and arts. humans uniquely use systems of symbolic communication such as language and art to express themselves and exchange ideas, as well as to organize themselves into purposeful groups. humans create complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety of values,[13] social norms, and rituals, which together undergird human society. curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other fields of knowledge. though most of human existence has been sustained by hunting and gathering in band societies,[14] many human societies transitioned to sedentary agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago,[15] domesticating plants and animals, thus enabling the growth of civilization. these human societies subsequently expanded, establishing various forms of government and culture around the world, and unifying people within regions to form states and empires. the rapid advancement of scientific and medical understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries permitted the development of more efficient medical tools and healthier lifestyles, resulting in increased lifespans and causing the human population to rise exponentially.[16][17][better source needed] the global human population is about 7.8 billion in 2020.[18][19] although it can be applied to other members of the genus homo, in common usage the word ""human"" generally refers to the only extant species—homo sapiens. the definition of h. sapiens itself is debated. some paleoanthropologists include fossils that others have allocated to different species, while the majority assign only fossils that align anatomically with the species as it exists today.[20] the english word ""human"" is a middle english loanword from old french humain, ultimately from latin hūmānus, the adjectival form of homō (""man"" - in the sense of humankind).[21] the native english term man can refer to the species generally (a synonym for humanity) as well as to human males. it may also refer to individuals of either sex, though this latter form is less common in contemporary english.[22] the species binomial ""homo sapiens"" was coined by carl linnaeus in his 18th-century work systema naturae.[23] the generic name ""homo"" is a learned 18th-century derivation from latin homō, which refers to humans of either sex.[24] the species name ""sapiens"" means ""wise"" or ""sapient;"" ""sapiens"" is the singular form, so there is no such word as ""sapien"".[25] the genus homo evolved and diverged from other hominins in africa several million years ago, after the human clade split from the chimpanzee lineage of the hominids (great apes) branch of the primates.[26] modern humans, specifically the subspecies homo sapiens sapiens, proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in eurasia 125,000–60,000 years ago,[27][28] australia around 40,000 years ago, the americas around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as hawaii, easter island, madagascar, and new zealand between the years 300 and 1280.[29][30] the closest living relatives of humans are chimpanzees and bonobos (genus pan),[31][32] as well as gorillas (genus gorilla).[33] the gibbons (family hylobatidae) and orangutans (genus pongo) were the first groups to split from the lineage leading to humans, then gorillas, and finally, chimpanzees. the splitting date between human and chimpanzee lineages is placed 4–8 million years ago, during the late miocene epoch.[34][35] during this split, chromosome 2 was formed from the joining of two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes.[36] the earliest fossils that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are sahelanthropus tchadensis, dating from 7 million years ago; orrorin tugenensis, dating from 5.7 million years ago; and ardipithecus kadabba, dating to 5.6 million years ago. from these early species, the australopithecines arose around 4 million years ago, diverging into robust (paranthropus) and gracile (australopithecus) branches,[37] possibly one of which—such as a. garhi, dating to 2.5 million years ago—is a direct ancestor of the genus homo.[38] the earliest members of homo evolved around 2.8 million years ago.[39] h. habilis has been considered the first species for which there is clear evidence of the use of stone tools.[40] nonetheless, the brains of h. habilis were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was bipedalism. during the next million years a process of encephalization began, and with the arrival of homo erectus in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. h. erectus were the first of the hominina to leave africa, between 1.3 to 1.8 million years ago. one population, also sometimes classified as a separate species homo ergaster, stayed in africa and evolved into homo sapiens. it is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools. the earliest transitional fossils between h. ergaster/erectus and archaic humans are from africa, such as homo rhodesiensis, but seemingly transitional forms have also been found in dmanisi, georgia. these descendants of h. erectus spread through eurasia c. 500,000 years ago, evolving into h. antecessor, h. heidelbergensis and h. neanderthalensis. fossils of anatomically modern humans that date from the middle paleolithic (about 200,000 years ago) include the omo-kibish i remains of ethiopia[41][42][43] and the fossils of herto bouri, ethiopia. earlier remains now classified as early homo sapiens, such as the jebel irhoud remains from morocco and the florisbad skull from south africa, have been dated to about 300,000 and 259,000 years old respectively.[44][5][45][46][47][48] fossil records of archaic homo sapiens from skhul in israel and southern europe begin around 90,000 years ago.[49] human evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioral changes that have taken place since the split between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. the most significant of these adaptations are 1. bipedalism, 2. increased brain size, 3. lengthened ontogeny (gestation and infancy), 4. decreased sexual dimorphism (neoteny). the relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.[50] other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a power and precision grip, a change first occurring in h. erectus.[51] bipedalism is the basic adaption of the hominin line, and it is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominins. the earliest bipedal hominin is considered to be either sahelanthropus[52] or orrorin, with ardipithecus, a full bipedal,[53] coming somewhat later.[citation needed] the knuckle walkers, the gorilla and chimpanzee, diverged around the same time, and either sahelanthropus or orrorin may be humans' last shared ancestor with those animals.[citation needed] the early bipedals eventually evolved into the australopithecines and later the genus homo.[citation needed] there are several theories of the adaptational value of bipedalism. it is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed up the hands for reaching and carrying food, because it saved energy during locomotion, because it enabled long-distance running and hunting, or as a strategy for avoiding hyperthermia by reducing the surface exposed to direct sun.[citation needed] the human species developed a much larger brain than that of other primates—typically 1,330 cm3 (81 cu in) in modern humans, over twice the size of that of a chimpanzee or gorilla.[54] the pattern of encephalization started with homo habilis which at approximately 600 cm3 (37 cu in) had a brain slightly larger than chimpanzees, and continued with homo erectus (800–1,100 cm3 (49–67 cu in)), and reached a maximum in neanderthals with an average size of 1,200–1,900 cm3 (73–116 cu in), larger even than homo sapiens (but less encephalized).[55] the pattern of human postnatal brain growth differs from that of other apes (heterochrony), and allows for extended periods of social learning and language acquisition in juvenile humans. however, the differences between the structure of human brains and those of other apes may be even more significant than differences in size.[56][57][58][59] the increase in volume over time has affected different areas within the brain unequally—the temporal lobes, which contain centers for language processing have increased disproportionately, as has the prefrontal cortex which has been related to complex decision making and moderating social behavior.[54] encephalization has been tied to an increasing emphasis on meat in the diet,[60][61] or with the development of cooking,[62] and it has been proposed [63] that intelligence increased as a response to an increased necessity for solving social problems as human society became more complex. the reduced degree of sexual dimorphism is primarily visible in the reduction of the male canine tooth relative to other ape species (except gibbons). another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of hidden estrus. humans are the only ape in which the female is intermittently fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as genital swelling during estrus). nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. these changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on pair bonding as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.[citation needed] as early homo sapiens dispersed, it encountered varieties of archaic humans both in africa and in eurasia, in eurasia notably homo neanderthalensis. since 2010, evidence for gene flow between archaic and modern humans during the period of roughly 100,000 to 30,000 years ago has been discovered. this includes modern human admixture in neanderthals, neanderthal admixture in all modern humans outside africa,[64][65] denisova hominin admixture in melanesians[66] as well as admixture from unnamed archaic humans to some sub-saharan african populations.[67] the ""out of africa"" migration of homo sapiens took place in at least two waves, the first around 130,000 to 100,000 years ago, the second (southern dispersal) around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago,[68][69] resulting in the colonization of australia around 65–50,000 years ago,[70][71][72] this recent out of africa migration derived from east african populations, which had become separated from populations migrating to southern, central and western africa at least 100,000 years earlier.[73] modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing archaic humans (either through competition or hybridization). by the beginning of the upper paleolithic period (50,000 bp), and likely significantly earlier[8][9][6][7][10][74][75][76] behavioral modernity, including language, music and other cultural universals had developed.[77][78] they inhabited eurasia and oceania by 40,000 years ago, and the americas at least 14,500 years ago.[79][80] until about 12,000 years ago (the beginning of the holocene), all humans lived as hunter-gatherers, generally in small nomadic groups known as band societies, often in caves. the neolithic revolution (the invention of agriculture) took place beginning about 10,000 years ago, first in the fertile crescent, spreading through large parts of the old world over the following millennia, and independently in mesoamerica about 6,000 years ago. access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements, the domestication of animals and the use of metal tools for the first time in history. agriculture and sedentary lifestyle led to the emergence of early civilizations (the development of urban development, complex society, social stratification and writing) from about 5,000 years ago (the bronze age), first beginning in mesopotamia.[81] the scientific revolution, technological revolution and the industrial revolution brought such discoveries as imaging technology, major innovations in transport, such as the airplane and automobile; energy development, such as coal and electricity.[82] with the advent of the information age at the end of the 20th century, modern humans live in a world that has become increasingly globalized and interconnected. human population growth and industrialisation has led to environmental destruction and pollution significantly contributing to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life called the holocene extinction,[83] which may be further accelerated by global warming in the future.[84] early human settlements were dependent on proximity to water and—depending on the lifestyle—other natural resources used for subsistence, such as populations of animal prey for hunting and arable land for growing crops and grazing livestock. modern humans, however, have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology, irrigation, urban planning, construction, deforestation and desertification.[87] human settlements continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters, especially those placed in hazardous locations and with low quality of construction.[88] deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of increasing comfort or material wealth, increasing the amount of available food, improving aesthetics, or improving ease of access to resources or other human settlements. with the advent of large-scale trade and transport infrastructure, proximity to these resources has become unnecessary, and in many places, these factors are no longer a driving force behind the success of a population. nonetheless, the manner in which a habitat is altered is often a major determinant in population change.[citation needed] the human body's ability to adapt to different environmental stresses allows humans to acclimatize to a wide variety of temperatures, humidity, and altitudes. as a result, humans are a cosmopolitan species found in almost all regions of the world, including tropical rainforest, arid desert, extremely cold arctic regions, and heavily polluted cities. most other species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited adaptability.[89] the human population is not, however, uniformly distributed on the earth's surface, because the population density varies from one region to another and there are large areas almost completely uninhabited, like antarctica.[90][91] most humans (61%) live in asia; the remainder live in the americas (14%), africa (14%), europe (11%), and oceania (0.5%).[92] within the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as antarctica, the deep sea, and outer space. human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions. human presence on other celestial bodies has been the case mainly with human-made robotic spacecraft[93][94][95] and with humans solely on the moon, two at a time for brief intervals between 1969 and 1972. long-term continous human presence in space has been the case in orbit around earth, uninterrupted since the initial crew of the international space station, arriving on 31 october 2000,[96] with peaks of thirteen humans at the same time in space.[97] since 1800, the human population has increased from one billion[98] to over seven billion.[99] the combined biomass of the carbon of all the humans on earth in 2018 was estimated at 60 million tons, about 10 times larger than that of all non-domesticated mammals.[100] in 2004, some 2.5 billion out of 6.3 billion people (39.7%) lived in urban areas.[101] problems for humans living in cities include various forms of pollution and crime,[102] especially in inner city and suburban slums. both overall population numbers and the proportion residing in cities are expected to increase significantly in the coming decades.[103] humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment. they are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.[104] currently, through land development, combustion of fossil fuels, and pollution, humans are thought to be the main contributor to global climate change.[105] if this continues at its current rate, it is predicted that climate change will wipe out half of all plant and animal species over the next century.[106][107] most aspects of human physiology are closely homologous to corresponding aspects of animal physiology. the human body consists of the legs, the torso, the arms, the neck, and the head. an adult human body consists of about 100 trillion (1014) cells. the most commonly defined body systems in humans are the nervous, the cardiovascular, the circulatory, the digestive, the endocrine, the immune, the integumentary, the lymphatic, the musculoskeletal, the reproductive, the respiratory, and the urinary system.[108][109] humans, like most of the other apes, lack external tails, have several blood type systems, have opposable thumbs, and are sexually dimorphic. the comparatively minor anatomical differences between humans and chimpanzees are largely a result of human bipedalism and larger brain size. one difference is that humans have a far faster and more accurate throw than other animals. humans are also among the best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom, but slower over short distances.[110][111] humans' thinner body hair and more productive sweat glands help avoid heat exhaustion while running for long distances.[112] as a consequence of bipedalism, human females have narrower birth canals. the construction of the human pelvis differs from other primates, as do the toes. a trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most mammals, especially given the larger head size of human babies compared to other primates. human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal while other primates do not, which makes humans the only species where females usually require help from their conspecifics (other members of their own species) to reduce the risks of birthing. as a partial evolutionary solution, human fetuses are born less developed and more vulnerable. chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. apart from bipedalism, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in smelling, hearing, digesting proteins, brain size, and the ability of language. humans' brains are about three times bigger than in chimpanzees. more importantly, the brain to body ratio is much higher in humans than in chimpanzees, and humans have a significantly more developed cerebral cortex, with a larger number of neurons. the mental abilities of humans are remarkable compared to other apes. humans' ability of speech is unique among primates. humans are able to create new and complex ideas, and to develop technology, which is unprecedented among other organisms on earth.[111] it is estimated that the worldwide average height for an adult human male is about 171 cm (5 ft 7 in), while the worldwide average height for adult human females is about 159 cm (5 ft 3 in).[113] shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals, but tends to be typical in the extremely aged.[114] through history human populations have universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions.[115] the average mass of an adult human is 59 kg (130 lb) for females and 77 kg (170 lb) for males.[116][117] like many other conditions, body weight and body type is influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals. (see obesity)[118][119] humans have a density of hair follicles comparable to other apes. however, human body hair is vellus hair, most of which is so short and wispy as to be practically invisible. in contrast (and unusually among species), a follicle of terminal hair on the human scalp can grow for many years before falling out.[120][121] humans have about 2 million sweat glands spread over their entire bodies, many more than chimpanzees, whose sweat glands are scarce and are mainly located on the palm of the hand and on the soles of the feet.[122] humans have the largest number of eccrine sweat glands among species. the dental formula of humans is: 2.1.2.32.1.2.3. humans have proportionately shorter palates and much smaller teeth than other primates. they are the only primates to have short, relatively flush canine teeth. humans have characteristically crowded teeth, with gaps from lost teeth usually closing up quickly in young individuals. humans are gradually losing their third molars, with some individuals having them congenitally absent.[123] like most animals, humans are a diploid eukaryotic species. each somatic cell has two sets of 23 chromosomes, each set received from one parent; gametes have only one set of chromosomes, which is a mixture of the two parental sets. among the 23 pairs of chromosomes there are 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. like other mammals, humans have an xy sex-determination system, so that females have the sex chromosomes xx and males have xy.[124] no two humans—not even monozygotic twins—are genetically identical. genes and environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility and mental abilities. the exact influence of genes and environment on certain traits is not well understood.[125][126] compared to the great apes, human gene sequences—even among african populations—are remarkably homogeneous.[127] on average, genetic similarity between any two humans is 99.5%-99.9%.[128][129][130][131][132][133] there is about 2–3 times more genetic diversity within the wild chimpanzee population than in the entire human gene pool.[134][135][136] a rough and incomplete human genome was assembled as an average of a number of humans in 2003, and currently efforts are being made to achieve a sample of the genetic diversity of the species (see international hapmap project). by present estimates, humans have approximately 22,000 genes.[137] the variation in human dna is very small compared to other species, possibly suggesting a population bottleneck during the late pleistocene (around 100,000 years ago), in which the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs.[138][139] by comparing mitochondrial dna, which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial eve, must have lived around 90,000 to 200,000 years ago.[140][141][142] the forces of natural selection have continued to operate on human populations, with evidence that certain regions of the genome display directional selection in the past 15,000 years.[143] as with other mammals, human reproduction takes place by internal fertilization via sexual intercourse. typically the gestation period is 38 weeks (9 months). at this point, most modern cultures recognize the baby as a person entitled to the full protection of the law, though some jurisdictions extend various levels of personhood earlier to human fetuses while they remain in the uterus. compared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous. painful labors lasting 24 hours or more are not uncommon and sometimes lead to the death of the mother, the child or both.[144] this is because of both the relatively large fetal head circumference and the mother's relatively narrow pelvis.[145][146] the chances of a successful labor increased significantly during the 20th century in wealthier countries with the advent of new medical technologies. in contrast, pregnancy and natural childbirth remain hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the world, with maternal death rates approximately 100 times greater than in developed countries.[147] in developed countries, infants are typically 3–4 kg (7–9 lb) in weight and 50–60 cm (20–24 in) in height at birth.[148][failed verification] however, low birth weight is common in developing countries, and contributes to the high levels of infant mortality in these regions.[149] both the mother and the father provide care for human offspring, in contrast to other primates, where parental care is mostly restricted to mothers.[150] helpless at birth, humans continue to grow for some years, typically reaching sexual maturity at 12 to 15 years of age. females continue to develop physically until around the age of 18, whereas male development continues until around age 21. the human life span can be split into a number of stages: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood and old age. the lengths of these stages, however, have varied across cultures and time periods. compared to other primates, humans experience an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence, where the body grows 25% in size. chimpanzees, for example, grow only 14%, with no pronounced spurt.[151] the presence of the growth spurt is probably necessary to keep children physically small until they are psychologically mature. humans are one of the few species in which females undergo menopause and become infertile decades before the end of their lives. all species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. it has been proposed that menopause increases a woman's overall reproductive success by allowing her to invest more time and resources in her existing offspring, and in turn their children (the grandmother hypothesis), rather than by continuing to bear children into old age.[152][153] evidence-based studies indicate that the life span of an individual depends on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices.[154] for various reasons, including biological/genetic causes,[155] women live on average about four years longer than men. as of 2018[update], the global average life expectancy at birth of a girl is estimated to be 74.9 years compared to 70.4 for a boy.[156][157] there are significant geographical variations in human life expectancy, mostly correlated with economic development—for example life expectancy at birth in hong kong is 84.8 years for girls and 78.9 for boys, while in eswatini, primarily because of aids, it is 31.3 years for both sexes.[158] the developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40 years. in the developing world the median age is between 15 and 20 years. while one in five europeans is 60 years of age or older, only one in twenty africans is 60 years of age or older.[159] the number of centenarians (humans of age 100 years or older) in the world was estimated by the united nations at 210,000 in 2002.[160] humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material.[161][162] human groups have adopted a range of diets from purely vegan to primarily carnivorous. in some cases, dietary restrictions in humans can lead to deficiency diseases; however, stable human groups have adapted to many dietary patterns through both genetic specialization and cultural conventions to use nutritionally balanced food sources.[163] the human diet is prominently reflected in human culture, and has led to the development of food science. until the development of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago, homo sapiens employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole means of food collection. this involved combining stationary food sources (such as fruits, grains, tubers, and mushrooms, insect larvae and aquatic mollusks) with wild game, which must be hunted and killed in order to be consumed.[164] it has been proposed that humans have used fire to prepare and cook food since the time of homo erectus.[165] around ten thousand years ago, humans developed agriculture,[166] which substantially altered their diet. this change in diet may also have altered human biology; with the spread of dairy farming providing a new and rich source of food, leading to the evolution of the ability to digest lactose in some adults.[167][168] agriculture led to increased populations, the development of cities, and because of increased population density, the wider spread of infectious diseases. the types of food consumed, and the way in which they are prepared, have varied widely by time, location, and culture. in general, humans can survive for two to eight weeks without food, depending on stored body fat. survival without water is usually limited to three or four days. about 36 million humans die every year from causes directly or indirectly related to starvation.[169] childhood malnutrition is also common and contributes to the global burden of disease.[170] however global food distribution is not even, and obesity among some human populations has increased rapidly, leading to health complications and increased mortality in some developed, and a few developing countries. worldwide over one billion people are obese,[171] while in the united states 35% of people are obese, leading to this being described as an ""obesity epidemic.""[172] obesity is caused by consuming more calories than are expended, so excessive weight gain is usually caused by an energy-dense diet.[171] there is biological variation in the human species—with traits such as blood type, genetic diseases, cranial features, facial features, organ systems, eye color, hair color and texture, height and build, and skin color varying across the globe. the typical height of an adult human is between 1.4 and 1.9 m (4 ft 7 in and 6 ft 3 in), although this varies significantly depending on sex, ethnic origin,[173][174] and family bloodlines. body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns. adult height for each sex in a particular ethnic group approximately follows a normal distribution. there is evidence that populations have adapted genetically to various external factors. the genes that allow adult humans to digest lactose are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle domestication and are more dependent on cow milk. sickle cell anemia, which may provide increased resistance to malaria, is frequent in populations where malaria is endemic. similarly, populations that have for a long time inhabited specific climates, such as arctic or tropical regions or high altitudes, tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for conserving energy in those environments—short stature and stocky build in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities at high altitudes. some populations have evolved highly unique adaptations to very specific environmental conditions, such as those advantageous to ocean-dwelling lifestyles and freediving in the bajau.[175] skin color tends to vary clinally and general correlates with the level of ultraviolet radiation in a particular geographic area, with darker skin mostly around the equator.[176][177][178][179] human skin color can range from darkest brown to lightest peach, or even nearly white or colorless in cases of albinism.[136] human hair ranges in color from white to red to blond to brown to black, which is the most frequent.[180] hair color depends on the amount of melanin, with concentrations fading with increased age, leading to grey or even white hair. most researchers believe that skin darkening is an adaptation that evolved as protection against ultraviolet solar radiation. light skin pigmentation protects against depletion of vitamin d, which requires sunlight to make.[181] human skin also has a capacity to darken (tan) in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.[182][183][184] there is relatively little variation between human geographical populations, and most of the variation that occurs is at the individual level.[136][185][186] of the 0.1%-0.5% of human genetic differentiation, 85% exists within any randomly chosen local population. genetic data shows that no matter how population groups are defined, two people from the same population group are almost as different from each other as two people from any two different population groups.[136][187][188][189] current genetic research has demonstrated that human populations native to the african continent are the most genetically diverse.[190] human genetic diversity decreases in native populations with migratory distance from africa, and this is thought to be the result of bottlenecks during human migration.[191][192] humans have lived in africa for the longest period of time, but only a part of africa's population migrated out of the continent into eurasia, bringing with them just a portion of the original african genetic variety. non-african populations, however, acquired new genetic inputs from local admixture with archaic populations, and thus have much greater variation from neanderthals and denisovans than is found in africa.[193] african populations also harbour the highest number of private genetic variants, or those not found in other places of the world. while many of the common variants found in populations outside of africa are also found on the african continent, there are still large numbers which are private to these regions, especially oceania and the americas.[193] furthermore, recent studies have found that populations in sub-saharan africa, and particularly west africa, have ancestral genetic variation which predates modern humans and has been lost in most non-african populations. this ancestry is thought to originate from admixture with an unknown archaic hominin that diverged before the split of neanderthals and modern humans.[194][195] the greatest degree of genetic variation exists between males and females. while the nucleotide genetic variation of individuals of the same sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1%-0.5%, the genetic difference between males and females is between 1% and 2%. males on average are 15% heavier and 15 cm (6 in) taller than females.[196][197] on average, men have about 40–50% more upper body strength and 20–30% more lower body strength than women.[198] women generally have a higher body fat percentage than men. women have lighter skin than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin d in females during pregnancy and lactation. as there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some x and y chromosome related conditions and disorders only affect either men or women. after allowing for body weight and volume, the male voice is usually an octave deeper than the female voice.[199] women have a longer life span in almost every population around the world.[200] human variation is highly non-concordant: many of the genes do not cluster together and are not inherited together. skin and hair color are mostly not correlated to height, weight, or athletic ability. humans do not share the same patterns of variation through geography. dark-skinned populations that are found in africa, australia, and south asia are not closely related to each other.[184][201][202][203][204][205] individuals with the same morphology do not necessarily cluster with each other by lineage, and a given lineage does not include only individuals with the same trait complex.[136][188][206] due to practices of endogamy, allele frequencies cluster by geographic, national, ethnic, cultural and linguistic boundaries. despite this, genetic boundaries around local populations do not biologically mark off any fully discrete groups of humans. much of human variation is continuous, often with no clear points of demarcation.[206][207][208][201][209][210][211][212][213][214] the human brain, the focal point of the central nervous system in humans, controls the peripheral nervous system. in addition to controlling ""lower,"" involuntary, or primarily autonomic activities such as respiration and digestion, it is also the locus of ""higher"" order functioning such as thought, reasoning, and abstraction.[215] these cognitive processes constitute the mind, and, along with their behavioral consequences, are studied in the field of psychology. humans have a larger and more developed prefrontal cortex than other primates, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition.[216] this has led humans to proclaim themselves to be more intelligent than any other known species.[217] objectively defining intelligence is difficult, with other animals adapting senses and excelling in areas that humans are unable to.[218] there are some traits that, although not strictly unique, do set humans apart from other animals.[219] humans may be the only animals who have episodic memory and who can engage in ""mental time travel"".[220] even compared with other social animals, humans have an unusually high degree of flexibility in their facial expressions.[221] humans are the only animals known to cry emotional tears.[222] humans are one of the few animals able to self-recognize in mirror tests[223] and there is also debate over what extent humans are the only animals with a theory of mind.[224] humans are generally diurnal. the average sleep requirement is between seven and nine hours per day for an adult and nine to ten hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. having less sleep than this is common among humans, even though sleep deprivation can have negative health effects. a sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including reduced memory, fatigue, aggression, and bodily discomfort.[225] during sleep humans dream, where they experience sensory images and sounds. dreaming is stimulated by the pons and mostly occurs during the rem phase of sleep.[226] the length of a dream can vary, from a few seconds up to 30 minutes.[227] humans have three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven;[228] however most dreams are immediately or quickly forgotten.[229] they are more likely to remember the dream if awakened during the rem phase. the events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-aware.[230] dreams can at times make a creative thought occur or give a sense of inspiration.[231] human consciousness, at its simplest, is ""sentience or awareness of internal or external existence"".[232] despite centuries of analyses, definitions, explanations and debates by philosophers and scientists, consciousness remains puzzling and controversial,[233] being ""at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives"".[234] the only widely agreed notion about the topic is the intuition that it exists.[235] opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied and explained as consciousness. some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience.[236] it is sometimes synonymous with 'the mind', and at other times, an aspect of it. historically it is associated with introspection, private thought, imagination and volition.[237] it now often includes some kind of experience, cognition, feeling or perception. it may be 'awareness', or 'awareness of awareness', or self-awareness.[238] there might be different levels or orders of consciousness,[239] or different kinds of consciousness, or just one kind with different features.[240] the process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses is known as cognition.[241] the human brain perceives the external world through the senses, and each individual human is influenced greatly by his or her experiences, leading to subjective views of existence and the passage of time.[242] the nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes' underlying behavior.[243] largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age.[244][245] this may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral development. psychologists have developed intelligence tests and the concept of intelligence quotient in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its distribution among population.[246] human motivation is not yet wholly understood. from a psychological perspective, maslow's hierarchy of needs is a well-established theory which can be defined as the process of satisfying certain needs in ascending order of complexity.[247] from a more general, philosophical perspective, human motivation can be defined as a commitment to, or withdrawal from, various goals requiring the application of human ability. furthermore, incentive and preference are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. volition may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and realization of goals in an optimal manner, a function beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as socialization.[248] emotions are biological states associated with the nervous system[249][250] brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioural responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure.[251][252] they are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, creativity,[253] and motivation. emotion has a significant influence on human behavior and their ability to learn.[254] acting on extreme or uncontrolled emotions can lead to social disorder and crime,[255] with studies showing criminals usually have a lower emotional intelligence than normal.[256] emotional experiences perceived as pleasant, such as joy, interest or contentment, contrast with those perceived as unpleasant, like anxiety, sadness, anger, and despair.[257] happiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. the definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. some define as experiencing the feeling of positive emotionial affects, while avoiding the negative ones.[258] others see it as an appraisal of life satisfaction, such as of quality of life.[259] recent research suggests that being happy might involve experiencing some negative emotions when humans feel they are warranted.[260] for humans, sexuality involves biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual feelings and behaviors.[261][262] because it is a broad term, which has varied with historical contexts over time, it lacks a precise definition.[262] the biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual response cycle.[261][262] sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life.[261][262] sexual desire, or libido, is a basic mental state present at the beginning of sexual behavior. studies show that men desire sex more than women and masturbate more often.[263] humans can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of sexual orientation,[264] although most humans are heterosexual.[265][266] while homosexual behavior occurs in many other animals, only humans and domestic sheep have so far been found to exhibit exclusive preference for same-sex relationships.[265] most evidence supports nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation,[265] as cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it.[266][267] research in neuroscience and genetics suggests that other aspects of human sexuality are biologically influenced as well.[268] love most commonly refers to a feeling of strong attraction or emotional attachment. it can be impersonal (the love of an object, ideal, or strong political or spiritual connection) or interpersonal (love between two humans).[269] different forms of love have been described, including familial love (love for family), platonic love (love for friends), romantic love (sexual passion) and guest love (hospitality).[270] romantic love has been shown to elicit brain responses similar to an addiction.[271] when in love dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and other chemicals stimulate the brain's pleasure center, leading to side effects such as increased heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement.[272] humanity's unprecedented set of intellectual skills were a key factor in the species' eventual technological advancement and concomitant domination of the biosphere.[275] disregarding extinct hominids, humans are the only animals known to teach generalizable information,[276] innately deploy recursive embedding to generate and communicate complex concepts,[277] engage in the ""folk physics"" required for competent tool design,[278][279] or cook food in the wild.[280] teaching and learning preserves the cultural and ethnographic identity of all the diverse human societies.[281] other traits and behaviors that are mostly unique to humans, include starting fires,[282] phoneme structuring[283] and vocal learning.[284] the division of humans into male and female gender roles has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power. cultural differences by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children.[285] gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.[286] while many species communicate, language is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a cultural universal.[287] unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open—an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols.[288][289] human language also has the capacity of displacement, using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.[123] language differs from other forms of communication in that it is modality independent; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, auditively in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and even through tactile media such as braille.[290] language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups.[291] there are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including sign languages, and many thousands more that are extinct.[292] art is a defining characteristics of humans and there is evidence for a relationship between creativity and language.[293] the earliest evidence of art was shell engravings made by homo erectus 300 000 years before humans evolved.[294] human art existed at least 75 000 years ago, with jewellery and drawings found in caves in south africa.[295][296] there are various hypothesis's as to why humans have adapted to the arts. these include allowing them to better problem solve issues, providing a means to control or influence other humans, encouraging cooperation and contribution within a society or increasing the chance of attracting a potential mate.[297] the use of imagination developed through art, combined with logic may have given early humans an evolutionary advantage.[293] evidence of humans engaging in musical activities predates cave art and so far music has been practised by all human cultures.[298] there exists a wide variety of music genres and ethnic musics; with humans musical abilities being related to other abilities, including complex social human behaviours.[298] it has been shown that human brains respond to music by becoming synchronised with the rhythm and beat, a process called entrainment.[299] dance is also a form of human expression found in all cultures[300] and may have evolved as a way to help early humans communicate.[301] listening to music and observing dance stimulates the orbitofrontal cortex and other pleasure sensing areas of the brain.[302] unlike speaking, reading and writing does not come naturally to humans and must be taught.[303] still literature has been present before the invention of words and language, with 30 000 year old paintings on walls inside some caves portraying a series of dramatic scenes.[304] one of the oldest surviving works of literature is the epic of gilgamesh, first engraved on ancient babylonian tablets about 4,000 years ago.[305] beyond simply passing down knowledge the use and sharing of imaginative fiction through stories might have helped develop humans capabilities for communication and increased the likelihood of securing a mate.[306] as well as entertainment, storytelling may also have been used as a way to provide the audience with moral lessons and encourage cooperation.[304] stone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5 million years ago.[307] the use and manufacture of tools has been put forward as the ability that defines humans more than anything else[308] and has historically been seen as an important evolutionary step.[309] the technology became much more sophisticated about 1.8 million years ago,[308] with the controlled use of fire beginning around 1 million years ago.[310] [311] the development of more complex tools and technologies allowed land to be cultivated and animals to be domesticated, thus proving essential in the development of agriculture—what is known as the neolithic revolution.[312] another wave of technological expansion brought about the industrial revolution, where the invention of automated machines brought major changes to humans lifestyles.[313] throughout history, humans have altered their appearance by wearing clothing.[314] it has been suggested humans started wearing clothing when they migrated north away from africa's warm climate.[315] religion is generally defined as a belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. some religions also have a moral code. the evolution and the history of the first religions have recently become areas of active scientific investigation.[316][317][318] while no other animals show religious behaviour, the empathy and imagination shown by chimpanzees could be a precursor to the evolution of human religion.[319] while the exact time when humans first became religious remains unknown, research shows credible evidence of religious behaviour from around the middle paleolithic era (45-200 thousand years ago).[320] it may have evolved to play a role in helping enforce and encourage cooperation between humans.[321] there is no accepted academic definition of what constitutes religion.[322] religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective in alignment with the geographic, social, and linguistic diversity of the planet.[322] religion can include a belief in life after death (commonly involving belief in an afterlife),[323] the origin of life,[324] the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and what is moral or immoral.[325] a common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in transcendent divine beings such as deities or a singular god, although not all religions are theistic.[326][327] although the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,[328] a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief.[329] in 2015 the majority were christian followed by muslims, hindus and buddhists,[330] although islam is growing the most rapidly and likely to overtake christianity by 2035.[331] in 2015 16% or slightly under 1.2 billion humans are irreligious. this includes humans who have no religious beliefs or do not identify with any religion.[331] an aspect unique to humans is their ability to transmit knowledge from one generation to the next and to continually build on this information to develop tools, scientific laws and other advances to pass on further.[332] this accumulated knowledge can be tested to answer questions or make predictions about how the universe functions and has been very successful in advancing human ascendancy.[333] historians have identified two major scientific revolutions in human history. the first coincides with the hellenistic period and the second with the renaissance.[334] a chain of events and influences led to the development of the scientific method, a process of observation and experimentation that is used to differentiate science from pseudoscience.[335] an understanding of mathematics is unique to humans, although other species of animal have some numerical cognition.[336] all of science can be divided into three major branches, the formal sciences (e.g., logic and mathematics), which are concerned with formal systems, the applied sciences (e.g., engineering, medicine), which are focused on practical applications, and the empirical sciences, which are based on empirical observation and are in turn divided into natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology) and social sciences (e.g., psychology, economics, sociology).[337] philosophy is a field of study where humans seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves and the world in which they live.[338] philosophical inquiry has been a major feature in the development of humans intellectual history.[339] it has been described as the ""no man’s land"" between the definitive scientific knowledge and the dogmatic religious teachings.[340] philosophy relies on reason and evidence unlike religion, but does not require the empirical observations and experiments provided by science.[341] major fields of philosophy include metaphysics, epistemology, rationality, and axiology (which includes ethics and aesthetics).[342] society is the system of organizations and institutions arising from interaction between humans. humans are highly social beings and tend to live in large complex social groups. they can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth, power, reputation and other factors.[343] the structure of social stratification and the degree of social mobility differs, especially between modern and traditional societies.[343] human groups range from the size of families to nations. the first forms of human social organization were families living in band societies as hunter-gatherers.[344] all human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents, children and other descendants (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). there is also a third type applied to godparents or adoptive children (fictive). these culturally defined relationships are refereed to as kinship. in many societies it is one of the most important social organizing principle and plays a role in transmitting status and inheritance.[345] all societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited and some also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations.[346] human ethnic groups are a social category who identify together as a group based on shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. these can be a common set of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area.[347][348] ethnicity is separate from the concept of race, which is based on physical characteristics, although both are socially constructed.[349] assigning ethnicity to certain population is complicated as even within common ethnic designations there can be a diverse range of subgroups and the makeup of these ethnic groups can change over time at both the collective and individual level.[350] also there is no generally accepted definition on what constitutes an ethnic group.[351] ethnic groupings can play a powerful role in the social identity and solidarity of ethno-political units. this has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.[352][353][354] the early distribution of political power was determined by the availability of fresh water, fertile soil, and temperate climate of different locations.[355] as farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between these different groups increased. this led to the development of governance within and between the communities.[356] as communities got bigger the need for some form of governance increased, as all large societies without a government have struggled to function.[357] humans have evolved the ability to change affiliation with various social groups relatively easily, including previously strong political alliances, if doing so is seen as providing personal advantages.[358] this cognitive flexibility allows individual humans to change their political ideologies, with those with higher flexibility less likely to support authoritarian and nationalistic stances.[359] governments create laws and policies that affect the citizens that they govern. there have been multiple forms of government throughout human history, each having various means of obtaining power and ability to exert diverse controls on the population.[360] as of 2017, more than half of all national governments are democracies, with 13% being autocracies and 28% containing elements of both.[361] many countries have formed international political alliances, the largest being the united nations with 193 member states.[362] trade, the voluntary exchange of goods and services, is seen as a characteristic that differentiates humans from other animals and has been cited as a practice that gave homo sapiens a major advantage over other hominids.[363][364] evidence suggests early h. sapiens made use of long-distance trade routes to exchange goods and ideas, leading to cultural explosions and providing additional food sources when hunting was sparse, while such trade networks did not exist for the now extinct neanderthals.[365][366] early trade likely involved materials for creating tools like obsidian.[367] the first truly international trade routes were around the spice trade through the roman and medieval periods.[368] other important trade routes to develop around this time include the silk road, incense route, amber road, tea horse road, salt route, trans-saharan trade route and the tin route.[369] early human economies were more likely to be based around gift giving instead of a bartering system.[370] early money consisted of commodities; the oldest being in the form of cattle and the most widely used being cowrie shells.[371] money has since evolved into governmental issued coins, paper and electronic money.[371] human study of economics is a social science that looks at how societies distribute scarce resources among different people.[372] there are massive inequalities in the division of wealth among humans; the eight richest humans are worth the same monetary value as the poorest half of all the human population.[373] humans willingness to kill other members of their species en masse though organised conflict has long been the subject of debate. one school of thought is that it has evolved as a means to eliminate competitors and has always been an innate human characteristic. the other suggests that war is a relatively recent phenomenon and appeared due to changing social conditions.[374] while not settled the current evidence suggests warlike predispositions only became common about 10,000 years ago, and in many places much more recently than that.[374] war has had a high cost on human life; it is estimated that during the 20th century, between 167 million and 188 million people died as a result of war.[375] "
swimming (sport)," swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. the sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). competitive swimming is one of the most popular olympic sports,[1] with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. in addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. a medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.[2] swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the acceptable form for each individual stroke.[3] there are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions.[4] although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health benefits associated with the sport. evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found, with the earliest evidence dating to stone age paintings from around 10,000 years ago. written references date from 2000 bc, with some of the earliest references to swimming including the iliad, the odyssey, the bible, beowulf, the quran and others. in 1538, nikolaus wynmann, a swiss–german professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu (the swimmer, or a dialogue on the art of swimming and joyful and pleasant to read).[5] swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in england. in 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, st george's baths was opened to the public.[6] by 1837, the national swimming society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, built around london. the recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, the amateur swimming association was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country.[7] in 1844 two native american participants at a swimming competition in london introduced the front crawl to a european audience. sir john arthur trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some south american natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873, winning a local competition in england. his stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today.[8] captain matthew webb was the first man to swim the english channel (between england and france), in 1875. using the breaststroke technique, he swam the channel 21.26 miles (34.21 km) in 21 hours and 45 minutes. his feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years, until t.w. burgess made the crossing in 1911. other european countries also established swimming federations; germany in 1882, france in 1890 and hungary in 1896. the first european amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in vienna. the world's first women's swimming championship was held in scotland in 1892.[9] men's swimming became part of the first modern olympic games in 1896 in athens. in 1902, the australian richmond cavill introduced freestyle to the western world. in 1908, the world swimming association, fédération internationale de natation (fina), was formed. women's swimming was introduced into the olympics in 1912; the first international swim meet for women outside the olympics was the 1922 women's olympiad. butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a variant of breaststroke, until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952. competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century. the goal of high level competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event. swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed. however, some professional swimmers who do not hold a national or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills. typically, an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the cycle, and then the workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches competition. the practice of reducing exercise in the days just before an important competition is called tapering. tapering is used to give the swimmer's body some rest without stopping exercise completely. a final stage is often referred to as ""shave and taper"": the swimmer shaves off all exposed hair for the sake of reducing drag and having a sleeker and more hydrodynamic feel in the water.[10] additionally, the ""shave and taper"" method refers to the removal of the top layer of ""dead skin"", which exposes the newer and richer skin underneath. this also helps to ""shave"" off mere milliseconds on your time.[11] swimming is an event at the summer olympic games, where male and female athletes compete in 16 of the recognized events each. olympic events are held in a 50-meter pool, called a long course pool. there are forty officially recognized individual swimming events in the pool; however the international olympic committee only recognizes 32 of them. the international governing body for competitive swimming is the fédération internationale de natation (""international swimming federation""), better known as fina. in open water swimming, where the events are swum in a body of open water (lake or sea), there are also 5 km, 10 km and 25 km events for men and women. however, only the 10 km event is included in the olympic schedule, again for both men and women. open-water competitions are typically separate to other swimming competitions with the exception of the world championships and the olympics. in competitive swimming, four major styles have been established. these have been relatively stable over the last 30–40 years with minor improvements. they are: in competition, only one of these styles may be used except in the case of the individual medley, or im, which consists of all four. in this latter event, swimmers swim equal distances of butterfly, then backstroke, breaststroke, and finally, freestyle.[12] in olympic competition, this event is swum in two distances – 200 and 400 meters. some short course competitions also include the 100-yard or 100-meter im – particularly, for younger or newer swimmers (typically under 14 years) involved in club swimming, or masters swimming (over 18). since the 1990s, the most drastic change in swimming has been the addition of the underwater dolphin kick. this is used to maximize the speed at the start and after the turns in all styles. the first successful use of it was by david berkoff. at the 1988 olympics, he swam most of the 100 m backstroke race underwater and broke the world record in the distance during the preliminaries. another swimmer to use the technique was denis pankratov at the 1996 olympics in atlanta, where he completed almost half of the 100 m butterfly underwater to win the gold medal. in the past decade, american competitive swimmers have shown the most use of the underwater dolphin kick to gain advantage, most notably olympic and world medal winners michael phelps and ryan lochte; however currently swimmers are not allowed to go any further than fifteen metres underwater due to rule changes by fina.[13] in addition, fina announced in 2014 that a single dolphin kick can be added to the breaststroke pullout prior to the first breaststroke kick.[14] while the dolphin kick is mostly seen in middle-distance freestyle events and in all distances of backstroke and butterfly, it is not usually used to the same effect in freestyle sprinting. that changed with the addition of the so-called ""technical"" suits around the european short course championships in rijeka, croatia in december 2008. there, amaury leveaux set new world records of 44.94 seconds in the 100 m freestyle, 20.48 seconds in the 50 m freestyle and 22.18 in the 50 m butterfly. unlike the rest of the competitors in these events, he spent at least half of each race submerged using the dolphin kick.[15] world championship pools must be 50 metres (160 ft) (long course) long and 25 metres (82 ft) wide, with ten lanes labelled zero to nine (or one to ten in some pools; zero and nine (or one and ten) are usually left empty in semi-finals and finals); the lanes must be at least 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) wide. they will be equipped with starting blocks at both ends of the pool and most will have automatic officiating equipment, including touch pads to record times and sensors to ensure the legality of relay takeovers. the pool must have a minimum depth of two metres.[16] other pools which host events under fina regulations are required to meet some but not all of these requirements. many of these pools have eight, or even six, instead of ten lanes and some will be 25 metres (82 ft) long, making them short course. world records that are set in short course pools are kept separate from those set in long course pools because it may be an advantage or disadvantage to swimmers to have more or less turns in a race. competitive swimming, from the club through to international level, tends to have an autumn and winter season competing in short course (25 metres or yards) pools and a spring and summer season competing in long course (50-metre) pools and in open water. in international competition and in club swimming in europe, the short course (25m) season lasts from september to december, and the long course (50m) season from january to august with open water in the summer months. these regulations are slowly being brought to competition in north america. as of right now, in club, school, and college swimming in the united states and canada, the short course (25 yards) season is much longer, from september to march. the long-course season takes place in 50-meter pools and lasts from april to the end of august with open water in the summer months. in club swimming in australasia, the short course (25m) season lasts from april to september, and the long course (50m) season from october to march with open water in the summer months. outside the united states, meters is the standard in both short and long course swimming, with the same distances swum in all events. in the american short course season, the 500-yard, 1000 yard, and 1650-yard freestyle events are swum as a yard is much shorter than a meter (100 yards equals 91.44 meters), while during the american long course season the 400 meter, 800 meter, and 1500-meter freestyle events are swum instead. beginning each swimming season racing in short course allows for shorter distance races for novice swimmers. for example, in the short course season if a swimmer wanted to compete in a stroke they had just learned, a 25-yard/meter race is available to them, opposed to the long course season when they would need to be able to swim at least 50 meters of that new stroke in order to compete. there are several types of officials,[17] which are needed to manage the competition.[18] referee: the referee has full control and authority over all officials. the referee will enforce all rules and decisions of fina and shall have the final answer to all questions relating to the actual conduct of anything regarding the meet, as well as the final settlement of which is not otherwise covered by the rules. the referee takes overall responsibility for running the meet and makes the final decisions as to who wins each race. referees call swimmers to the blocks with short blasts of his or her whistle. this is the signal for the swimmers to stand next to their blocks. then the referee will blow a long whistle that will tell the swimmers to step on the block. for backstroke events, the long whistle is the signal for the swimmers to jump into the water. the referee will then blow another long whistle, signalling the swimmers to grab the gutter or the provided block handle. finally the referee will hand over the rest to the starter by directing his or her hand to the starter. starter: the starter has full control of the swimmers from the time the referee turns the swimmers over to him/her until the race commences. a starter begins the race by saying, ""take your mark."" at this point, the swimmers will get into stationary positions in which they would like to start their race. after all swimmers have assumed their stationary position, the starter will push a button on the starting system, signaling the start of a race with a loud noise (usually a beep or a horn) and flash from a strobe light. a starter sends the swimmers off the blocks and may call a false start if a swimmer leaves the block before the starter sends them. a starter may also choose to recall the race after the start for any reason or request the swimmers to ""stand"", ""relax"" or ""step down"" if he or she believes that (a) particular swimmer(s) has gotten an unfair advantage at the start. clerk of course: the clerk of course (also called the ""bullpen"") assembles swimmers prior to each event, and is responsible for organizing (""seeding"") swimmers into heats based on their times. heats are generally seeded from slowest to fastest, where swimmers with no previous time for an event are assumed to be the slowest. the clerk of the course is also responsible for recording and reporting swimmers who have chosen to ""scratch"" (not swim) their events after they have signed up or qualified to a semifinal or final. the clerk is also responsible for enforcing rules of the swim meet if a swimmer chooses to not show up (""no show"" - ns) his or her events. timekeepers: each timekeeper takes the time of the swimmers in the lane assigned to him/her. unless a video backup system is used, it may be necessary to use the full complement of timekeepers even when automatic officiating equipment is used. a chief timekeeper assigns the seating positions for all timekeepers and the lanes for which they are responsible. in most competitions there will be one or more timekeepers per lane. in international competitions where full automatic timing and video placing equipment is in use timekeepers may not be required. inspectors of turns: one inspector of turns is assigned to one or more lanes at each end of the pool. each inspector of turns ensures that swimmers comply with the relevant rules for turning, as well as the relevant rules for start and finish of the race. inspectors of turns shall report any violation on disqualification reports detailing the event, lane number, and the infringement delivered to the chief inspector of turns who will immediately convey the report to the referee. judges of stroke: judges of stroke are located on each side of the pool. they follow the swimmers during their swim back and forth across the pool. they ensure that the rules related to the style of swimming designated for the event are being observed, and observe the turns and the finishes to assist the inspectors of turns. finish judges: finish judges determine the order of finish and make sure the swimmers finish in accordance with the rules (two hands simultaneously for breaststroke and butterfly, on the back for backstroke, etc.) if an official observes a swimmer breaking a rule concerning the stroke he or she is swimming, the official will report what they have seen to the referee. the referee can disqualify (or dq) any swimmer for any violation of the rules that he/she personally observes or for any violation reported to them by other authorised officials. all disqualifications are subject to the decision and discretion of the referee. those who are disqualified may choose to protest their disqualification . protests are reviewed by a panel of officials instead of the deck referee or stroke judges who may have made the initial disqualification report. brands such as arena, speedo, tyr, and adidas are popular regular swimwear brands. the most durable material for regular swimming is polyester. the main difference between competition and regular swimwear is that competition swimwear is tighter and compresses the muscles of the swimmers. regular swimwear is easier to put on and more comfortable for leisure activities. the most used practice swimwear for men includes briefs and jammers. males generally swim barechested. there was controversy after the beijing olympic games in 2008 when many olympic swimmers broke records an unprecedented number of times using revolutionary swimsuits that covered their entire legs. to highlight the issue, in 2008, 70 world records were broken in one year, and 66 olympic records were broken in one olympic games (there were races in beijing where the first five finishers were swimming faster than the old world record). as of 1 january 2010, men are only allowed to wear suits from the waist to the knees.[23] they are also only permitted to wear one piece of swimwear; they cannot wear briefs underneath jammers. this rule was enacted after the controversy in the beijing olympics and rome world championships. women wear one-piece suits with thicker and higher backs for competition, though two-piece suits can also be worn during practice. backs vary mainly in strap thickness and geometric design. most common styles include: racerback, axel back, corset, diamondback, and butterfly-back/fly-back. there are also different style lengths: three-quarter length (reaches the knees), regular length (shoulders to hips), and bikini style (two-piece). as of 1 january 2010, in competition, women must wear suits that do not go past the shoulders or knees. drag suits are used to increase water resistance against the swimmer to help them train for competitions. other forms of drag wear include nylons, old suits, and t-shirts: articles that increase friction in the water to build strength during training, and thus increase speed once drag items are removed for competition. some swimmers practice in basketball shorts over their bathing suit, wearing two bathing suits, or wearing an extra bathing suit with holes cut in the material. many swimmers also shave areas of exposed skin before end-of-season competitions to reduce friction in the water. the practice gained popularity after the 1956 olympics, when murray rose and jon henricks came shaved and won gold medals for australia.[24] freshly shaven skin is less resistant when in the water. in addition, a 1989 study demonstrated that shaving improves a swimmer's overall performance by reducing drag.[25] the disadvantages of using a drag suit include the depletion of proper stroke. this is caused by the swimmer's own fatigue. when the swimmer becomes more fatigued, different muscle groups become more tired. consequently, the swimmer will try to engage another group of muscle to do the same thing, which can cause the stroke efficiency to drop.[citation needed] elite and international swimming comprises the highest level of competition available to swimmers, including competitions such as the olympic games and fina world aquatics championships. swimming creates a mix of levels, including: fully professional, semi-professional, and amateur. fully professional swimmers will typically get a salary both from their national governing body and from outside sponsors, semi-professionals a small stipend from their national governing body, and amateurs receive no funding. outside of these major championships prize money is low – the 2015 fina world cup series has a total prize fund of $3,000 per race shared between the top three[26] and the 2014–15 usa grand prix series $1,800[27] compared to the 2015 world aquatics championships fund of $60,000 per race shared between the top eight.[28] open water swimming is swimming outside a regular pool, usually in a lake, or sometimes ocean. popularity of the sport has grown in recent years, particularly since the 10 km open water event was added as an olympic event in 2005, contested for the first time in the 2008 olympic games in beijing.[29] new recent technology has developed much faster swimsuits. full body suits have been banned, but swimmers at the very top levels still wear suits that have been lasered together because stitching creates drag. the disadvantage of these suits is that they are often uncomfortable and tight, and can tear easily if not handled carefully. the largest ocean swim's in terms of numbers of participants are in australia, with the pier to pub, cole classic and melbourne swim classic all with roughly 5000 swimming participants. swimming times have dropped over the years due to superior training techniques and new technical developments. the first four olympics were not held in pools, but in open water (1896 – the mediterranean, 1900 – the seine river, 1904 – an artificial lake, 1906 – the mediterranean). the 1904 olympics' freestyle race was the only one ever measured at 100 yards, instead of the usual 100 meters. a 100-meter pool was built for the 1908 olympics and sat in the center of the main stadium's track and field oval. the 1912 olympics, held in the stockholm harbor, marked the beginning of electronic timing.[clarification needed] male swimmers wore full-body suits until the 1940s, which caused more drag in the water than their modern swimwear counterparts experience. competition suits now include engineered fabric and designs to reduce swimmers' drag in the water and prevent athlete fatigue. in addition, over the years, pool designs have lessened the drag. some design considerations allow for the reduction of swimming resistance, making the pool faster. these include proper pool depth, elimination of currents, increased lane width, energy absorbing racing lane lines and gutters, and the use of other innovative hydraulic, acoustic, and illumination designs. there have been major changes in starting blocks over the past years. starting blocks used to be small, narrow and straight[30] but through time they have become bigger and wider and nowadays the surface of the block is angled towards the swimming pool.[31] in addition, starting blocks now have a ""wedge"" which is a raised, slanting platform situated at the rear of the main block. this enables the swimmer to adopt a crouched position at a 90 degrees angle and push off quicker with the rear leg to increase their launch power.[32] the 1924 summer olympics were the first to use the standard 50-meter pool with marked lanes. in the freestyle, swimmers originally dove from the pool walls, but diving blocks were incorporated at the 1936 summer olympics. the tumble turn was developed by the 1950s and goggles were first used in the 1976 olympics. there were also changes in the late 20th century in terms of technique. breaststrokers are now allowed to dip their heads completely under water to glide, which allows for a longer stroke and faster time. however, the breaststrokers must bring their heads up at the completion of each cycle. in addition, a key hole pull in the breaststroke start and turns has been added to help speed up the stroke. now off the start and turns, breaststrokers are allowed one butterfly kick to help increase their speed. this change was made official in december 2014.[33] backstrokers are now allowed to turn on their stomachs before the wall in order to perform a ""flip-turn"". previously, they had to reach and flip backwards and a variation of it, known as a ""bucket turn"" or a ""suicide turn"", is sometimes used in individual medley events to transition from backstroke to breaststroke. the foundation of fina in 1908 signaled the commencement of recording the first official world records in swimming.[34] at that time records could be established in any swimming pool of length not less than 25 yards, and records were also accepted for intermediate distance split times from long-distance events. today world records will only be accepted when times are reported by automatic officiating equipment, or semi-automatic officiating equipment in the case of automatic officiating equipment system malfunction.[35] records in events such as 300 yd, 300 m, 1000 yd, and 1000 m freestyle, 400 m backstroke, and 400 m and 500 m breaststroke were no longer ratified from 1948. a further removal of the 500 yd and 500 m freestyle, 150 m backstroke, and 3×100 m medley relay from the record listings occurred in 1952. in 1952, the national federations of the united states and japan proposed at the fina congress the separation of records achieved in long-course and short-course pools, however it was four more years before action came into effect with the congress deciding to retain only records held in 50 m pools as the official world record listings. by 1969 there were thirty-one events in which fina recognised official world records – 16 for men, 15 for women – closely resembling the event schedule that was in use at the olympic games. the increase in accuracy and reliability of electronic timing equipment led to the introduction of hundredths of a second to the time records from 21 august 1972. records in short course (25 m) pools began to be officially approved as ""short course world records"" from 3 march 1991. prior to this date, times in short course (25 m) pools were not officially recognised, but were regarded a ""world best time"" (wbt). from 31 october 1994 times in 50 m backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly were added to the official record listings. fina currently recognises world records in the following events for both men and women.[36] — denotes instances that cannot be determined swimming is a healthy activity that can be done by most people throughout their life.[37] it is a low-impact workout that has several mental and bodily health benefits all while being a good recreational activity. swimming builds endurance, muscle strength, and cardiovascular fitness.[38] correspondingly, it also improves weight loss while being a safer alternative of working out for someone who is injured or for women who are pregnant.[39] swimming requires less effort than other sports, but the athletes will get the results they are looking for.[40] the u.s. census bureau reports that two and a half hours per week of aerobic physical activity such as swimming can decrease the risk of chronic illnesses, and help regenerate healthy cells.[41] furthermore, swimming is linked to better cognitive function; also lowering the risk of type ii diabetes, high blood pressure, and a stroke. it can improve lung and heart strength while it tones muscles in a full body workout.[37] people can typically exercise longer in water than on land without increased effort and minimal joint or muscle pain. when in the water the body undergoes less physical stress thus releasing pressure from the joints.[42][43][44][45] in addition to the physical benefits of swimming, lower stress levels and occurrences of depression and anxiety are known to decrease while swimming. swimming is a meditation sport meaning there is an increase of blood flow to the brain which allows an individual to evaluate stressors more calmly.[46] the activity can help increase the memory for older aged individuals who suffer from dementia.[47] the rotator cuff in the shoulder is most susceptible to injury in swimmers. injury to the rotator cuff results from repeated trauma and overuse.[48] the joints are more prone to injury when the arm is repetitively used in a position above the horizontal line of the body. this position occurs in each of the four swimming strokes in every cycle of the arms. out of the four tendons in the rotator cuff, the supraspinatus is most prone to tearing. rotator cuff impingement is due to pressure on the rotator cuff from part of the scapula as the arm is raised. the best way to prevent injury is catching the issue early. typically, poor technique and over excessive use of the muscle group can be the primary causes of injury. through communication between swimmers, coaches, parents, and medical professionals, any issue can be diagnosed prior to a serious injury. additionally, proper warm-up, stretches, and strength training exercises should be completed before any rigorous movements. in treating a rotator cuff injury, the most important factor is time. due to the nature of the joint being primarily stabilized by muscle and tendon, the injury must be fully healed to prevent recurrence. returning to swimming or other demanding exercises too soon can result in degeneration of a tendon which might result in a rupture. during the rehabilitation period, focus should be placed on rotator cuff and scapular strengthening.[49] another common injury is breaststroke knee, also known as swimmer's knee. this injury is caused by the kicking movement used while swimming breaststroke. the kicking movement will cause wear and tear on the knee and it will eventually lead to constant pain. in recent studies it has been found that initially, the pain is only experienced when the kick was executed, but eventually the pain spread to other regular day-to-day activities, athletic and non-athletic.[50] "
boxing," boxing is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring. amateur boxing is both an olympic and commonwealth games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games—it also has its own world championships. boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called rounds. a winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or resignation of an opponent. when the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. in the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, professional bouts are considered a draw. in olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria. while humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human history, the earliest evidence of fist-fighting sporting contests date back to the ancient near east in the 3rd and 2nd millennia bc.[2] the earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to ancient greece, where boxing was established as an olympic game in 688 bc.[2] boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in great britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the marquess of queensberry rules. the earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a sumerian relief in iraq from the 3rd millennium bc.[2] a relief sculpture from egyptian thebes (c. 1350 bc) shows both boxers and spectators.[2] these early middle-eastern and egyptian depictions showed contests where fighters were either bare-fisted or had a band supporting the wrist.[2] the earliest evidence of fist fighting with the use of gloves can be found on minoan crete (c. 1500–1400 bc).[2] various types of boxing existed in ancient india. the earliest references to musti-yuddha come from classical vedic epics such as the ramayana and rig veda. the mahabharata describes two combatants boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts.[3] duels (niyuddham) were often fought to the death.[citation needed] during the period of the western satraps, the ruler rudradaman—in addition to being well-versed in ""the great sciences"" which included indian classical music, sanskrit grammar, and logic—was said to be an excellent horseman, charioteer, elephant rider, swordsman and boxer.[4] the gurbilas shemi, an 18th-century sikh text, gives numerous references to musti-yuddha. in ancient greece boxing was a well developed sport and enjoyed consistent popularity. in olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd olympiad, 688 bc. the boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. there were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue. weight categories were not used, which meant heavyweights had a tendency to dominate. the style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard, in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. it was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body was common.[5] boxing was a popular spectator sport in ancient rome.[6] fighters protected their knuckles with leather thongs wrapped around their fists. eventually harder leather was used and the thong became a weapon. metal studs were introduced to the thongs to make the cestus. fighting events were held at roman amphitheatres. records of classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the western roman empire when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. however, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. there was also a sport in ancient rus called kulachniy boy or ""fist fighting"". as the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. the sport would later resurface in england during the early 16th century in the form of bare-knuckle boxing sometimes referred to as prizefighting. the first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in england appeared in 1681 in the london protestant mercury, and the first english bare-knuckle champion was james figg in 1719.[7] this is also the time when the word ""boxing"" first came to be used. this earliest form of modern boxing was very different. contests in mr. figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. on 6 january 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in britain when christopher monck, 2nd duke of albemarle (and later lieutenant governor of jamaica) engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize. early fighting had no written rules. there were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. in general, it was extremely chaotic. an early article on boxing was published in nottingham, 1713, by sir thomas parkyns, a successful wrestler from bunny, nottinghamshire, who had practised the techniques he described. the article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, progymnasmata: the inn-play, or cornish-hugg wrestler, described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.[8] the first boxing rules, called the broughton's rules, were introduced by champion jack broughton in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.[9] under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches. these rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers; they permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to end the round and begin the 30-second count at any time. thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover. however, this was considered ""unmanly""[10] and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the seconds of the boxers.[11] in modern boxing, there is a three-minute limit to rounds (unlike the downed fighter ends the round rule). intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, they used different punching technique to preserve their hands because the head was a common target to hit full out.[dubious – discuss][citation needed] almost all period manuals have powerful straight punches with the whole body behind them to the face (including forehead) as the basic blows.[12][13][unreliable source?] the london prize ring rules introduced measures that remain in effect for professional boxing to this day, such as outlawing butting, gouging, scratching, kicking, hitting a man while down, holding the ropes, and using resin, stones or hard objects in the hands, and biting.[14] in 1867, the marquess of queensberry rules were drafted by john chambers for amateur championships held at lillie bridge in london for lightweights, middleweights and heavyweights. the rules were published under the patronage of the marquess of queensberry, whose name has always been associated with them. there were twelve rules in all, and they specified that fights should be ""a fair stand-up boxing match"" in a 24-foot-square or similar ring. rounds were three minutes with one-minute rest intervals between rounds. each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down, and wrestling was banned. the introduction of gloves of ""fair-size"" also changed the nature of the bouts. an average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.[16] the gloves can be used to block an opponent's blows. as a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face. through the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy. outlawed in england and much of the united states, prizefights were often held at gambling venues and broken up by police.[17] brawling and wrestling tactics continued, and riots at prizefights were common occurrences. still, throughout this period, there arose some notable bare knuckle champions who developed fairly sophisticated fighting tactics. the english case of r v. coney in 1882 found that a bare-knuckle fight was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, despite the consent of the participants. this marked the end of widespread public bare-knuckle contests in england. the first world heavyweight champion under the queensberry rules was ""gentleman jim"" corbett, who defeated john l. sullivan in 1892 at the pelican athletic club in new orleans.[18] the first instance of film censorship in the united states occurred in 1897 when several states banned the showing of prize fighting films from the state of nevada,[19] where it was legal at the time. throughout the early twentieth century, boxers struggled to achieve legitimacy.[20] they were aided by the influence of promoters like tex rickard and the popularity of great champions such as john l. sullivan. the modern sport arose from illegal venues and outlawed prizefighting and has become a multibillion-dollar commercial enterprise. a majority of young talent still comes from poverty-stricken areas around the world.[citation needed] places like mexico, africa, south america, and eastern europe prove to be filled with young aspiring athletes who wish to become the future of boxing. even in the u.s., places like the inner cities of new york, and chicago have given rise to promising young talent. according to rubin, ""boxing lost its appeal with the american middle class, and most of who boxes in modern america come from the streets and are street fighters"".[21] the marquess of queensberry rules have been the general rules governing modern boxing since their publication in 1867.[22] a boxing match typically consists of a determined number of three-minute rounds, a total of up to 9 to 12 rounds. a minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. the fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls. up to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging and other, more subjective, measures. because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been ""robbed"" or unfairly denied a victory. each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more ""seconds"" may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signalled end of each round. a bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to ""go the distance"". the fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. with three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. a boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out; such bouts are said to have ended ""inside the distance"". if a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue. some jurisdictions require the referee to count to eight regardless of if the fighter gets up before. should the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled ""knocked out"" (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by knockout (ko). a ""technical knock-out"" (tko) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a ""three-knockdown rule"", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a tko. a tko is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. a ""standing eight"" count rule may also be in effect. this gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he or she feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. after counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he or she is fit to continue. for scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown. in general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. the boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. they also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). they are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the head or neck (called a ""rabbit-punch"") or the kidneys. they are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between). if a ""clinch"" – a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause – is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to ""punch out"" of the clinch). when a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue. violations of these rules may be ruled ""fouls"" by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. an intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. a fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a ""no contest"" result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed. unheard of in the modern era, but common during the early 20th century in north america, a ""newspaper decision (nws)"" might be made after a no decision bout had ended. a ""no decision"" bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. but this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. officially, however, a ""no decision"" bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only. often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report. throughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by money, as the fighters competed for prize money, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result. the modern olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an olympic sport in 1908. in their current form, olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts.[23] currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the australian institute for sport has demonstrated a prototype of an automated boxing scoring system, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in cuba and some former soviet republics. for most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career. western boxers typically participate in one olympics and then turn pro, cubans and other socialist countries have an opportunity to collect multiple medals.[24] in 2016, professional boxers were admitted in the olympic games and other tournaments sanctioned by aiba.[25] this was done in part to level the playing field and give all of the athletes the same opportunities government-sponsored boxers from socialist countries and post-soviet republics have.[26] however, professional organizations strongly opposed that decision.[27][28] amateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at the olympic games, commonwealth games, asian games, etc. in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the olympic and commonwealth games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national aba (amateur boxing association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds. competitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. there are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. the white end is just a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under 165 pounds (75 kg), thus allowing them to wear ten ounce gloves. a punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. a referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. a belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches – any boxer repeatedly landing low blows below the belt is disqualified. referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. if this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced.[29] amateur bouts which end this way may be noted as ""rsc"" (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (rsco), outscored opponent (rscos), injury (rsci) or head injury (rsch). professional bouts are usually much longer than amateur bouts, typically ranging from ten to twelve rounds, though four-round fights are common for less experienced fighters or club fighters. there are also some two- and three-round professional bouts, especially in australia. through the early 20th century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters like jack dempsey. fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the 20th century until the early 1980s, when the death of boxer kim duk-koo eventually prompted the world boxing council and other organizations sanctioning professional boxing to reduce the limit to twelve rounds. headgear is not permitted in professional bouts, and boxers are generally allowed to take much more damage before a fight is halted. at any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. in that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. a technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. for this reason, fighters often employ cutmen, whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. if a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. in contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.[30] ""style"" is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. no two fighters' styles are alike, as each is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes. three main styles exist in boxing: outside fighter (""boxer""), brawler (or ""slugger""), and inside fighter (""swarmer""). these styles may be divided into several special subgroups, such as counter puncher, etc. the main philosophy of the styles is, that each style has an advantage over one, but disadvantage over the other one. it follows the rock paper scissors scenario - boxer beats brawler, brawler beats swarmer, and swarmer beats boxer.[31] a classic ""boxer"" or stylist (also known as an ""out-fighter"") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. they are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent, methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler.[32] out-fighters need reach, hand speed, reflexes, and footwork. notable out-fighters include muhammad ali, larry holmes, joe calzaghe, wilfredo gómez, salvador sánchez, cecilia brækhus, gene tunney,[33] ezzard charles,[34] willie pep,[35] meldrick taylor, ricardo ""finito"" lópez, floyd mayweather jr., roy jones jr., sugar ray leonard, miguel vázquez, sergio ""maravilla"" martínez, vitali klitschko, wladimir klitschko and guillermo rigondeaux. this style was also used by fictional boxer apollo creed. a boxer-puncher is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter),[36] but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. a boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style. notable boxer-punchers include muhammad ali, canelo álvarez, sugar ray leonard, roy jones jr., wladimir klitschko, vasyl lomachenko, lennox lewis, joe louis,[37] wilfredo gómez, oscar de la hoya, archie moore, miguel cotto, nonito donaire, sam langford,[38] henry armstrong,[39] sugar ray robinson,[40] tony zale, carlos monzón,[41] alexis argüello, érik morales, terry norris, marco antonio barrera, naseem hamed, thomas hearns, julian jackson and gennady golovkin. counter punchers are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. they use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. a fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks. to be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork. notable counter punchers include muhammad ali, joe calzaghe, vitali klitschko, evander holyfield, max schmeling, chris byrd, jim corbett, jack johnson, bernard hopkins, laszlo papp, jerry quarry, anselmo moreno, james toney, marvin hagler, juan manuel márquez, humberto soto, floyd mayweather jr., roger mayweather, pernell whitaker, sergio gabriel martinez and guillermo rigondeaux. this style of boxing is also used by fictional boxer little mac. counter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches. the more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. the counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. this style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. they usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. a large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. as such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style. a brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power. many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. they may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. however, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as wilfredo gómez, prince naseem hamed and danny garcía. a brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing). examples of this style include george foreman, rocky marciano, julio césar chávez, roberto durán, danny garcía, wilfredo gómez, sonny liston, john l. sullivan, max baer, prince naseem hamed, ray mancini, david tua, arturo gatti, micky ward, brandon ríos, ruslan provodnikov, michael katsidis, james kirkland, marcos maidana, jake lamotta, manny pacquiao, and ireland's john duddy. this style of boxing was also used by fictional boxers rocky balboa and james ""clubber"" lang. brawlers tend to be more predictable and easy to hit but usually fare well enough against other fighting styles because they train to take punches very well. they often have a higher chance than other fighting styles to score a knockout against their opponents because they focus on landing big, powerful hits, instead of smaller, faster attacks. oftentimes they place focus on training on their upper body instead of their entire body, to increase power and endurance. they also aim to intimidate their opponents because of their power, stature and ability to take a punch. in-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called ""pressure fighters"") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of hooks and uppercuts. mainly mexican, irish, irish-american, puerto rican, and mexican-american boxers popularized this style. a successful in-fighter often needs a good ""chin"" because swarming usually involves being hit with many jabs before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. in-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. however, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting. the essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. many short in-fighters use their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, this permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. a distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts, they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; mike tyson was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. marvin hagler was known for his hard ""chin"", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. some in-fighters, like mike tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. the key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving. notable in-fighters include henry armstrong, aaron pryor, julio césar chávez, jack dempsey, shawn porter, miguel cotto, joe frazier, danny garcía, mike tyson, manny pacquiao, rocky marciano,[42] wayne mccullough, james braddock, gerry penalosa, harry greb,[43][44] david tua, james toney and ricky hatton. this style was also used by the street fighter character balrog. all fighters have primary skills with which they feel most comfortable, but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge. for example, an out-fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch, or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches. old history of the development of boxing and its prevalence contribute to fusion of various types of martial arts and the emergence of new ones that are based on them. for example, a combination of boxing and sportive sambo techniques gave rise to a combat sambo. there is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others. in general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a brawler, and a brawler has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in rock paper scissors. naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the cliché amongst boxing fans and writers that ""styles make fights."" brawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. a famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be george foreman's knockout victory over joe frazier in their original bout ""the sunshine showdown"". although in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. the in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. on the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. the in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. for example, the swarming joe frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger george foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer muhammad ali in their three fights. joe louis, after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ rocky marciano would have caused him style problems even in his prime. the boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. the out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. if the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. if he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. most classic boxers, such as muhammad ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers. an example of a style matchup was the historical fight of julio césar chávez, a swarmer or in-fighter, against meldrick taylor, the boxer or out-fighter (see julio césar chávez vs. meldrick taylor). the match was nicknamed ""thunder meets lightning"" as an allusion to punching power of chávez and blinding speed of taylor. chávez was the epitome of the ""mexican"" style of boxing. taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. chávez remained relentless in his pursuit of taylor and due to his greater punching power chávez slowly punished taylor. coming into the later rounds, taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with chávez, which only gave chávez a greater chance to cause damage. while there was little doubt that taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. going into the final round, taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. chávez would have to knock taylor out to claim a victory, whereas taylor merely needed to stay away from the mexican legend. however, taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with chávez. as he did so, taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought taylor closer to victory unless chávez could knock him out. with about a minute left in the round, chávez hit taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit taylor with well-placed shots. finally, with about 25 seconds to go, chávez landed a hard right hand that caused taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing chávez back ahead of him. suddenly chávez stepped around taylor, positioning him so that taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from chávez' desperate final flurry. chávez then nailed taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. by using the ring ropes to pull himself up, taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. referee richard steele asked taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but taylor failed to answer. steele then concluded that taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a tko victory for chávez with only two seconds to go in the bout. since boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent damage to bones in the hand. most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without wrist wraps and boxing gloves. hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not use them. gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. the brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place. a mouthguard is important to protect the teeth[45][46] and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. while older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts. boxers practice their skills on several types of punching bags. a small, tear-drop-shaped ""speed bag"" is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical ""heavy bag"" filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. the double-end bag is usually connected by elastic on the top and bottom and moves randomly upon getting struck and helps the fighter work on accuracy and reflexes. in addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also use sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines, jump rope, and medicine balls. boxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. this is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. in addition, they also allow trainers to make boxers utilize footwork and distances more accurately. boxing matches typically take place in a boxing ring, a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. the term ""ring"" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general. the modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. the modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as jack johnson. upright stance semi-crouch full crouch in a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. the lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. the rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. the chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. the stance described is considered the ""textbook"" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents. in order to retain their stance boxers take 'the first step in any direction with the foot already leading in that direction.'[47] different stances allow for bodyweight to be differently positioned and emphasised; this may in turn alter how powerfully and explosively a type of punch can be delivered. for instance, a crouched stance allows for the bodyweight to be positioned further forward over the lead left leg. if a lead left hook is thrown from this position, it will produce a powerful springing action in the lead leg and produce a more explosive punch. this springing action could not be generated effectively, for this punch, if an upright stance was used or if the bodyweight was positioned predominantly over the back leg.[48] mike tyson was a keen practitioner of a crouched stance and this style of power punching. the preparatory positioning of the bodyweight over the bent lead leg is also known as an isometric preload. left-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. the southpaw stance, conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand. north american fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many european fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. the positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots. there are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. any punch other than a jab is considered a power punch. if a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. for a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. for clarity, the following discussion will assume a right-handed boxer. jab cross - in counter-punch with a looping hook uppercut these different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or ""combos."" the most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the ""one-two combo."" this is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully. a large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a ""roundhouse,"" ""haymaker,"" ""overhand,"" or sucker-punch. relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard. wide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. for this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in. another unconventional punch is the rarely used bolo punch, in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm. an illegal punch to the back of the head or neck is known as a rabbit punch. both the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, resulting in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. generally the analogous opposite is true of the footwork and torso movement. there are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below. slipping bobbing blocking (with the arms) cover-up (with the gloves) clinching footwork pulling away bolo punch overhand (overcut) in boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds for 1 minute and where his trainers stand. typically, three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the cutman. the trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is doing wrong as well as encouraging him if he is losing. the cutman is a cutaneous doctor responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts, blood and excessive swelling. this is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts or swelling that threaten the boxer's eyes. in addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. the corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase ""to throw in the towel"", meaning to give up, derives from this practice).[53] this can be seen in the fight between diego corrales and floyd mayweather. in that fight, corrales' corner surrendered despite corrales' steadfast refusal. knocking a person unconscious or even causing a concussion may cause permanent brain damage.[54] there is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person.[55] from 1980 to 2007, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and toughman fighters died due to ring or training injuries.[56] in 1983, editorials in the journal of the american medical association called for a ban on boxing.[57] the editor, dr. george lundberg, called boxing an ""obscenity"" that ""should not be sanctioned by any civilized society.""[58] since then, the british,[59] canadian[60] and australian[61] medical associations have called for bans on boxing. supporters of the ban state that boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal. dr. bill o'neill, boxing spokesman for the british medical association, has supported the bma's proposed ban on boxing: ""it is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, and we feel that we must have a total ban on boxing.""[62] opponents respond that such a position is misguided opinion, stating that amateur boxing is scored solely according to total connecting blows with no award for ""injury"". they observe that many skilled professional boxers have had rewarding careers without inflicting injury on opponents by accumulating scoring blows and avoiding punches winning rounds scored 10-9 by the 10-point must system, and they note that there are many other sports where concussions are much more prevalent.[63] in 2007, one study of amateur boxers showed that protective headgear did not prevent brain damage,[64] and another found that amateur boxers faced a high risk of brain damage.[65] the gothenburg study analyzed temporary levels of neurofiliment light in cerebral spinal fluid which they conclude is evidence of damage, even though the levels soon subside. more comprehensive studies of neurologiocal function on larger samples performed by johns hopkins university in 1994 and accident rates analyzed by national safety council in 2017 show amateur boxing is a comparatively safe sport.[66][67] in 1997, the american association of professional ringside physicians was established to create medical protocols through research and education to prevent injuries in boxing.[68][69] professional boxing is forbidden in iceland,[70] iran, saudi arabia and north korea. it was banned in sweden until 2007 when the ban was lifted but strict restrictions, including four three-minute rounds for fights, were imposed.[71] it was banned in albania from 1965 until the fall of communism in 1991; it is now legal there. norway legalized professional boxing in december 2014.[72] as active and dynamic sports, boxing provides the following benefits: with a careful and thoughtful approach, boxing can be quite beneficial to health. for example, gemma ruegg, a two-weight regional champion from bournemouth in dorset, boxed throughout her pregnancy and returned to the ring three weeks after giving birth to her daughter. earlier, boxing helped her to get rid of alcohol addiction and depression.[73] the sport of boxing has two internationally recognized boxing halls of fame; the international boxing hall of fame (ibhof).[74] in 2013, the boxing hall of fame las vegas opened in las vegas, nv founded by steve lott, former assistant manager for mike tyson.[75] the international boxing hall of fame opened in canastota in 1989. the first inductees in 1990 included jack johnson, benny leonard, jack dempsey, henry armstrong, sugar ray robinson, archie moore, and muhammad ali. other world-class figures[76] include salvador sanchez, jose napoles, roberto ""manos de piedra"" durán, ricardo lopez, gabriel ""flash"" elorde, vicente saldivar, ismael laguna, eusebio pedroza, carlos monzón, azumah nelson, rocky marciano, pipino cuevas and ken buchanan. the hall of fame's induction ceremony is held every june as part of a four-day event. the fans who come to canastota for the induction weekend are treated to a number of events, including scheduled autograph sessions, boxing exhibitions, a parade featuring past and present inductees, and the induction ceremony itself. the boxing hall of fame las vegas features the $75 million espn classic sports fight film and tape library and radio broadcast collection. the collection includes the fights of all the great champions including: muhammad ali, mike tyson, george foreman, roberto durán, marvin hagler, jack dempsey, joe louis, joe frazier, rocky marciano and sugar ray robinson. it is this exclusive fight film library that will separate the boxing hall of fame las vegas from the other halls of fame which do not have rights to any video of their sports. the inaugural inductees included muhammad ali, henry armstrong, tony canzoneri, ezzard charles, julio césar chávez sr., jack dempsey, roberto durán, joe louis, and sugar ray robinson[77] there are various organization and websites, that rank boxers in both weight class and pound-for-pound manner. "
surfing," surfing is a surface water pastime in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward part, or face of a moving wave, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. however, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools. the term surfing usually refers to the act of riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. there are several types of boards. the moche of peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing. another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, when a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. body surfing, where the wave is surfed without a board and uses the surfer's own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing. the closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand. three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden. in tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle such as a personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and sea kayaking do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. recently with the use of v-drive boats, wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. the guinness book of world records recognized a 23.8 m (78 ft) wave ride by garrett mcnamara at nazaré, portugal as the largest wave ever surfed.[1] in polynesian culture, surfing was an important activity. modern surfing as we know it today is thought to have originated in hawaii. the history of surfing in hawaii refers back to the 4th-century a.d. where polynesians began to make their way to the hawaiian islands from tahiti and the marquesas islands. they brought many of their customs with them including playing in the surf on paipo (belly) boards. it was in hawaii that the art of standing and surfing upright on boards was invented.[2] surfing was then witnessed by various european explorers in polynesia. surfing may have been observed by british explorers at tahiti in 1767. samuel wallis and the crew members of hms dolphin were the first britons to visit the island in june of that year. another candidate is the botanist joseph banks[3] who was part of the first voyage of james cook on the hms endeavour, arriving on tahiti on 10 april 1769. lieutenant james king was the first person to write about the art of surfing on hawaii, when he was completing the journals of captain james cook (upon cook's death in 1779). when mark twain visited hawaii in 1866 he wrote, in one place, we came upon a large company of naked natives of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing.[4] references to surf riding on planks and single canoe hulls are also verified for pre-contact samoa, where surfing was called fa'ase'e or se'egalu (see augustin krämer, the samoa islands[5]), and tonga, far pre-dating the practice of surfing by hawaiians and eastern polynesians by over a thousand years. about three to five thousand years ago, cultures in ancient peru surfed on reed watercraft for fishing.[6][7] the moche culture used the caballito de totora (little horse of totora), with archaeological evidence showing its use around 200 ce.[8] an early description of the inca surfing in callao was documented by jesuit missionary josé de acosta in his 1590 publication historia natural y moral de las indias, writing:[9].mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} it is true to see them go fishing in callao de lima, was for me a thing of great recreation, because there were many and each one in a balsilla caballero, or sitting stubbornly cutting the waves of the sea, which is rough where they fish, they looked like the tritons, or neptunes, who paint upon the water. in july 1885, three teenage hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, st. mathew's hall in san mateo, and came to cool off in santa cruz, california. there, david kawānanakoa, edward keliʻiahonui and jonah kūhiō kalanianaʻole surfed the mouth of the san lorenzo river on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians kim stoner and geoff dunn.[10] in 1890 the pioneer in agricultural education john wrightson reputedly became the first british surfer when instructed by two hawaiian students at his college.[11][12][13] george freeth (8 november 1883 – 7 april 1919) is often credited as being the ""father of modern surfing"". he is thought to have been the first modern surfer. in 1907, the eclectic interests of the land baron henry e. huntington brought the ancient art of surfing to the california coast. while on vacation, huntington had seen hawaiian boys surfing the island waves. looking for a way to entice visitors to the area of redondo beach, where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired a young hawaiian to ride surfboards. george freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 500 cm (16 ft) hardwood boards that were popular at that time. when he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original ""long board"", which made him the talk of the islands. to the delight of visitors, freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the hotel redondo. another native hawaiian, duke kahanamoku, spread surfing to both the u.s. and australia, riding the waves after displaying the swimming prowess that won him olympic gold medals in 1912 and 1920. in 1975, a professional tour started.[14] that year margo oberg became the first female professional surfer.[14] swell is generated when the wind blows consistently over a large area of open water, called the wind's fetch. the size of a swell is determined by the strength of the wind and the length of its fetch and duration. because of this, the surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on coastlines exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense low pressure systems. local wind conditions affect wave quality since the surface of a wave can become choppy in blustery conditions. ideal conditions include a light to moderate ""offshore"" wind, because it blows into the front of the wave, making it a ""barrel"" or ""tube"" wave. waves are left handed and right handed depending upon the breaking formation of the wave. waves are generally recognized by the surfaces over which they break.[15] for example, there are beach breaks, reef breaks and point breaks. the most important influence on wave shape is the topography of the seabed directly behind and immediately beneath the breaking wave. the contours of the reef or bar front become stretched by diffraction. each break is different since each location's underwater topography is unique. at beach breaks, sandbanks change shape from week to week. surf forecasting is aided by advances in information technology. mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells around the globe. swell regularity varies across the globe and throughout the year. during winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the north and south polar fronts shift toward the equator. the predominantly westerly winds generate swells that advance eastward, so waves tend to be largest on west coasts during winter months. however, an endless train of mid-latitude cyclones cause the isobars to become undulated, redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics. east coasts also receive heavy winter swells when low-pressure cells form in the sub-tropics, where slow moving highs inhibit their movement. these lows produce a shorter fetch than polar fronts, however, they can still generate heavy swells since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. the variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels since a wave reaching the end of a fetch behaves as if the wind died. during summer, heavy swells are generated when cyclones form in the tropics. tropical cyclones form over warm seas, so their occurrence is influenced by el niño & la niña cycles. their movements are unpredictable. surf travel and some surf camps offer surfers access to remote, tropical locations, where tradewinds ensure offshore conditions. since winter swells are generated by mid-latitude cyclones, their regularity coincides with the passage of these lows. swells arrive in pulses, each lasting for a couple of days, with a few days between each swell. the availability of free model data from the noaa has allowed the creation of several surf forecasting websites. tube shape is defined by length to width ratio. a perfectly cylindrical vortex has a ratio of 1:1. other forms include: tube speed is defined by angle of peel line. the value of good surf in attracting surf tourism has prompted the construction of artificial reefs and sand bars. artificial surfing reefs can be built with durable sandbags or concrete, and resemble a submerged breakwater. these artificial reefs not only provide a surfing location, but also dissipate wave energy and shelter the coastline from erosion. ships such as seli 1 that have accidentally stranded on sandy bottoms, can create sandbanks that give rise to good waves.[16] an artificial reef known as chevron reef was constructed in el segundo, california in hopes of creating a new surfing area. however, the reef failed to produce any quality waves and was removed in 2008. in kovalam, south west india, an artificial reef has, however, successfully provided the local community with a quality lefthander, stabilized coastal soil erosion, and provided good habitat for marine life.[17] asr ltd., a new zealand-based company, constructed the kovalam reef and is working on another reef in boscombe, england. even with artificial reefs in place, a tourist's vacation time may coincide with a ""flat spell"", when no waves are available. completely artificial wave pools aim to solve that problem by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however there are only a handful of wave pools that can simulate good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. the seagaia ocean dome, located in miyazaki, japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. able to generate waves with up to 3 m (10 ft) faces, the specialized pump held water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. this allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. lefts, rights, and a-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. the ocean dome cost about $2 billion to build and was expensive to maintain.[18] the ocean dome was closed in 2007. in england, construction is nearing completion on the wave,[19] situated near bristol, which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature. there are two main types of artificial waves that exist today. one being artificial or stationary waves which simulate a moving, breaking wave by pumping a layer of water against a smooth structure mimicking the shape of a breaking wave. because of the velocity of the rushing water the wave and the surfer can remain stationary while the water rushes by under the surfboard. artificial waves of this kind provide the opportunity to try surfing and learn its basics in a moderately small and controlled environment near or far from locations with natural surf. surfers represent a diverse culture based on riding the waves. some people practice surfing as a recreational activity while others make it the central focus of their lives. surfing culture is most dominant in hawaii and california because these two states offer the best surfing conditions. however, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout america. some historical markers of the culture included the woodie, the station wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as boardshorts, the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing. surfers also wear wetsuits in colder regions. the sport is also a significant part of australia's eastern coast sub-cultural life,[20] especially in new south wales, where the weather and water conditions are most favourable for surfing. during the 1960s, as surfing caught on in california, its popularity spread through american pop culture. several teen movies, starting with the gidget series in 1959, transformed surfing into a dream life for american youth. later movies, including beach party (1963), ride the wild surf (1964), and beach blanket bingo (1965) promoted the california dream of sun and surf. surf culture also fueled the early records of the beach boys. the sport of surfing now represents a multibillion-dollar industry especially in clothing and fashion markets. the world surf league (wsl) runs the championship tour, hosting top competitors in some of the best surf spots around the globe. a small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers. sixty-six surfboarders on a 13 m (42 ft) long surfboard set a record in huntington beach, california for most people on a surfboard at one time. dale webster consecutively surfed for 14,641 days, making it his main life focus. when the waves were flat, surfers persevered with sidewalk surfing, which is now called skateboarding. sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. to create the feel of the wave, surfers even sneak into empty backyard swimming pools to ride in, known as pool skating. eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes with the invention of the snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard. many other board sports have been invented over the years, but all can trace their heritage back to surfing. many surfers claim to have a spiritual connection with the ocean, describing surfing, the surfing experience, both in and out of the water, as a type of spiritual experience or a religion.[21] standup surfing begins when the surfer paddles toward shore in an attempt to match the speed of the wave (the same applies whether the surfer is standup paddling, bodysurfing, boogie-boarding or using some other type of watercraft, such as a waveski or kayak). once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride the wave. the basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave. a common problem for beginners is being able to catch the wave at all. surfers' skills are tested by their ability to control their board in difficult conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and carving (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). more advanced skills include the floater (riding on top of the breaking curl of the wave), and off the lip (banking off the breaking wave). a newer addition to surfing is the progression of the air whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave. the tube ride is considered to be the ultimate maneuver in surfing. as a wave breaks, if the conditions are ideal, the wave will break in an orderly line from the middle to the shoulder, enabling the experienced surfer to position themselves inside the wave as it is breaking. this is known as a tube ride. viewed from the shore, the tube rider may disappear from view as the wave breaks over the rider's head. the longer the surfer remains in the tube, the more successful the ride. this is referred to as getting tubed, barrelled, shacked or pitted. some of the world's best known waves for tube riding include pipeline on the north shore of oahu, teahupoo in tahiti and g-land in java. other names for the tube include ""the barrel"", and ""the pit"". hanging ten and hanging five are moves usually specific to long boarding. hanging ten refers to having both feet on the front end of the board with all of the surfer's toes off the edge, also known as nose-riding. hanging five is having just one foot near the front, with five toes off the edge. cutback: generating speed down the line and then turning back to reverse direction. floater: suspending the board atop the wave. very popular on small waves. top-turn: turn off the top of the wave. sometimes used to generate speed and sometimes to shoot spray. bottom turn: a turn at the bottom or mid face of the wave, this manuever is used to set up other manuevers such as the top turn, cutback and even aerials. airs/aerials: these maneuvers have been becoming more and more prevalent in the sport in both competition and free surfing. an air is when the surfer can achieve enough speed and approach a certain type of section of a wave that is supposed to act as a ramp and launch the surfer above the lip line of the wave, “catching air”, and landing either in the transition of the wave or the whitewash when hitting a close-out section. airs can either be straight airs or rotational airs. straight airs have minimal rotation if any, but definitely no more rotation than 90 degrees. rotational airs require a rotation of 90 degrees or more depending on the level of the surfer. types of rotations: the glossary of surfing includes some of the extensive vocabulary used to describe various aspects of the sport of surfing as described in literature on the subject.[22][23] in some cases terms have spread to a wider cultural use. these terms were originally coined by people who were directly involved in the sport of surfing. many popular surfing destinations have surf schools and surf camps that offer lessons. surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. they are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. all-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. most surf lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land, followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or ""softboards"". the softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, due to the fact it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards. funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard.[24] new and inexperienced surfers typically learn to catch waves on softboards around the 210 to 240 cm (7 to 8 ft) funboard size. due to the softness of the surfboard the chance of getting injured is substantially minimized. typical surfing instruction is best performed one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. the most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. the ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break softly, as opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. when available, a sandy seabed is generally safer. surfing can be broken into several skills: paddling strength, positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. paddling out requires strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (duck diving, eskimo roll). take-off positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. the surfer must pop up quickly as soon as the wave starts pushing the board forward. preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking.[25] balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. practicing with a balance board or swing boarding helps novices master the art. the repetitive cycle of paddling, popping up, and balancing requires stamina, explosivity, and near-constant core stabilization. having a proper warm up routine can help prevent injuries.[26] surfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards, longboards, stand up paddle boards (sups), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards, surf mats and macca's trays. surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to 370 cm (12 ft) long and having a mass of 70 kg (150 lb)). lighter balsa wood surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability. most modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (pu), with one or more wooden strips or ""stringers"", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (pe). an emerging board material is epoxy resin and expanded polystyrene foam (eps) which is stronger and lighter than traditional pu/pe construction. even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. since epoxy/eps surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional pu/pe board of similar size, shape and thickness. this makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. however, a common complaint of eps boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional pu/pe board. for this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials. other equipment includes a leash (to stop the board from drifting away after a wipeout, and to prevent it from hitting other surfers), surf wax, traction pads (to keep a surfer's feet from slipping off the deck of the board), and fins (also known as skegs) which can either be permanently attached (glassed-on) or interchangeable. sportswear designed or particularly suitable for surfing may be sold as boardwear (the term is also used in snowboarding). in warmer climates, swimsuits, surf trunks or boardshorts are worn, and occasionally rash guards; in cold water surfers can opt to wear wetsuits, boots, hoods, and gloves to protect them against lower water temperatures. a newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of titanium to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility. in recent years, there have been advancements in technology that have allowed surfers to pursue even bigger waves with added elements of safety. big wave surfers are now experimenting with inflatable vests or colored dye packs to help decrease their odds of drowning.[27] there are many different surfboard sizes, shapes, and designs in use today. modern longboards, generally 270 to 300 cm (9 to 10 ft) in length, are reminiscent of the earliest surfboards, but now benefit from modern innovations in surfboard shaping and fin design. competitive longboard surfers need to be competent at traditional walking manoeuvres, as well as the short-radius turns normally associated with shortboard surfing. the modern shortboard began life in the late 1960s and has evolved into today's common thruster style, defined by its three fins, usually around 180 to 210 cm (6 to 7 ft) in length. the thruster was invented by australian shaper simon anderson. midsize boards, often called funboards, provide more maneuverability than a longboard, with more flotation than a shortboard. while many surfers find that funboards live up to their name, providing the best of both surfing modes, others are critical. there are also various niche styles, such as the egg, a longboard-style short board targeted for people who want to ride a shortboard but need more paddle power. the fish, a board which is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a swallow tail). the fish often has two or four fins and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. for big waves there is the gun, a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pin tail) specifically designed for big waves. the physics of surfing involves the physical oceanographic properties of wave creation in the surf zone, the characteristics of the surfboard, and the surfer's interaction with the water and the board. ocean waves are defined as a collection of dislocated water parcels that undergo a cycle of being forced past their normal position and being restored back to their normal position.[29] wind caused ripples and eddies form waves that gradually gain speed and distance (fetch). waves increase in energy and speed, and then become longer and stronger.[30] the fully developed sea has the strongest wave action that experiences storms lasting 10-hours and creates 15 meter wave heights in the open ocean.[29] the waves created in the open ocean are classified as deep-water waves. deep-water waves have no bottom interaction and the orbits of these water molecules are circular; their wavelength is short relative to water depth and the velocity decays before the reaching the bottom of the water basin.[29] deep waves have depths greater than ½ their wavelengths. wind forces waves to break in the deep sea. deep-water waves travel to shore and become shallow water waves. shallow water waves have depths less than ½ of their wavelength. shallow wave's wavelengths are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. the wave velocity effects the entire water basin. the water interacts with the bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. the drag interaction pulls on the bottom of the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. this phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.[29] the surf zone is place of convergence of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. a wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. this speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break.[30] in the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds to the beach and interact with local winds to make surfing waves.[30][31] different onshore and off-shore wind patterns in the surf zone create different types of waves. onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns and are more suitable for experienced surfers.[30][31] light offshore winds create smoother waves, while strong direct offshore winds cause plunging or large barrel waves.[30] barrel waves are large because the water depth is small when the wave breaks. thus, the breaker intensity (or force) increases, and the wave speed and height increase.[30] off-shore winds produce non-surfable conditions by flattening a weak swell. weak swell is made from surface gravity forces and has long wavelengths.[30][32] surfing waves can be analyzed using the following parameters: breaking wave height, wave peel angle (α), wave breaking intensity, and wave section length. the breaking wave height has two measurements, the relative heights estimated by surfers and the exact measurements done by physical oceanographers. measurements done by surfers were 1.36 to 2.58 times higher than the measurements done by scientists. the scientifically concluded wave heights that are physically possible to surf are 1 to 20 meters.[30] the wave peel angle is one of the main constituents of a potential surfing wave. wave peel angle measures the distance between the peel-line and the line tangent to the breaking crest line. this angle controls the speed of the wave crest. the speed of the wave is an addition of the propagation velocity vector (vw) and peel velocity vector (vp), which results in the overall velocity of the wave (vs).[30] wave breaking intensity measures the force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a ""barrel wave""). wave section length is the distance between two breaking crests in a wave set. wave section length can be hard to measure because local winds, non-linear wave interactions, island sheltering, and swell interactions can cause multifarious wave configurations in the surf zone.[30] the parameters breaking wave height, wave peel angle (α), and wave breaking intensity, and wave section length are important because they are standardized by past oceanographers who researched surfing; these parameters have been used to create a guide that matches the type of wave formed and the skill level of surfer.[30] table 1 shows a relationship of smaller peel angles correlating with a higher skill level of surfer. smaller wave peel angles increase the velocities of waves. a surfer must know how to react and paddle quickly to match the speed of the wave to catch it. therefore, more experience is required to catch a low peel angle waves. more experienced surfers can handle longer section lengths, increased velocities, and higher wave heights.[30] different locations offer different types of surfing conditions for each skill level. a surf break is an area with an obstruction or an object that causes a wave to break. surf breaks entail multiple scale phenomena. wave section creation has micro-scale factors of peel angle and wave breaking intensity. the micro-scale components influence wave height and variations on wave crests. the mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. macro-scale processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves. types of surf breaks are headlands (point break), beach break, river/estuary entrance bar, reef breaks, and ledge breaks.[30] a headland or point break interacts with the water by causing refraction around the point or headland. the point absorbs the high frequency waves and long period waves persist, which are easier to surf. examples of locations that have headland or point break induced surf breaks are dunedin (new zealand), raglan (new zealand), malibu (california), rincon (california), and kirra (australia).[30] a beach break happens where waves break from offshore waves, and onshore sandbars and rips. wave breaks happen successively at beach breaks. example locations are tairua and aramoana beach (new zealand) and the gold coast (australia).[30] a river or estuary entrance bar creates waves from the ebb tidal delta, sediment outflow, and tidal currents. an ideal estuary entrance bar exists in whangamata bar, new zealand.[30] a reef break is conducive to surfing because large waves consistently break over the reef. the reef is usually made of coral, and because of this, many injuries occur while surfing reef breaks. however, the waves that are produced by reef breaks are some of the best in the world. famous reef breaks are present in padang padang (indonesia), pipeline (hawaii), uluwatu (bali), and teahupo'o (tahiti).[30][33] when surfing a reef break, the depth of the water needs to be considered as surfboards have fins on the bottom of the board. a ledge break is formed by steep rocks ledges that makes intense waves because the waves travel through deeper water then abruptly reach shallower water at the ledge. shark island, australia is a location with a ledge break. ledge breaks create difficult surfing conditions, sometimes only allowing body surfing as the only feasible way to confront the waves.[30] jetties are added to bodies of water to regulate erosion, preserve navigation channels, and make harbors. jetties are classified into four different types and have two main controlling variables: the type of delta and the size of the jetty.[34] the first classification is a type 1 jetty. this type of jetty is significantly longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. the effect of a type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. these waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. an example of a type 1 jetty is mission beach, san diego, california. this 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 at the mouth of mission bay. the surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. the bathymetry of the sea bottom in mission bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty.[34] the waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves. a type 2 jetty occurs in an ebb tidal delta, a delta transitioning between high and low tide. this area has shallow water, refraction, and a distinctive seabed shapes that creates large wave heights.[34] an example of a type 2 jetty is called ""the poles"" in atlantic beach, florida. atlantic beach is known to have flat waves, with exceptions during major storms. however, ""the poles"" has larger than normal waves due to a 500-meter jetty that was installed on the south side of the st. johns. this jetty was built to make a deep channel in the river. it formed a delta at ""the poles"". this is special area because the jetty increases wave size for surfing, when comparing pre-conditions and post-conditions of the southern st. johns river mouth area.[34] the wave size at ""the poles"" depends on the direction of the incoming water. when easterly waters (from 55°) interact with the jetty, they create waves larger than southern waters (from 100°). when southern waves (from 100°) move toward ""the poles"", one of the waves breaks north of the southern jetty and the other breaks south of the jetty. this does not allow for merging to make larger waves. easterly waves, from 55°, converge north of the jetty and unite to make bigger waves.[34] a type 3 jetty is in an ebb tidal area with an unchanging seabed that has naturally created waves. examples of a type 3 jetty occurs in “southside” tamarack, carlsbad, california.[34] a type 4 jetty is one that no longer functions nor traps sediment. the waves are created from reefs in the surf zone. a type 4 jetty can be found in tamarack, carlsbad, california.[34] rip currents are fast, narrow currents that are caused by onshore transport within the surf zone and the successive return of the water seaward.[35][36] the wedge bathymetry makes a convenient and consistent rip current of 5–10 meters that brings the surfers to the “take off point” then out to the beach.[34] oceanographers have two theories on rip current formation. the wave interaction model assumes that two edges of waves interact, create differing wave heights, and cause longshore transport of nearshore currents. the boundary interaction model assumes that the topography of the sea bottom causes nearshore circulation and longshore transport; the result of both models is a rip current.[35] rip currents can be extremely strong and narrow as they extend out of the surf zone into deeper water, reaching speeds from 0.5 m/s (1.6 ft/s) and up to 2.5 m/s (8.2 ft/s),[36][37] which is faster than any human can swim. the water in the jet is sediment rich, bubble rich, and moves rapidly.[36] the rip head of the rip current has long shore movement. rip currents are common on beaches with mild slopes that experience sizeable and frequent oceanic swell.[37] the vorticity and inertia of rip currents have been studied. from a model of the vorticity of a rip current done at scripps institute of oceanography, it was found that a fast rip current extends away from shallow water, the vorticity of the current increases, and the width of the current decreases.[37][38] this model also acknowledges that friction plays a role and waves are irregular in nature.[38] from data from sector-scanning doppler sonar at scripps institute of oceanography, it was found that rip currents in la jolla, ca lasted several minutes, reoccurred one to four times per hour, and created a wedge with a 45° arch and a radius 200–400 meters.[36] a longer surfboard of 300 cm (10 ft) causes more friction with the water; therefore, it will be slower than a smaller and lighter board with a length of 180 cm (6 ft). longer boards are good for beginners who need help balancing. smaller boards are good for more experienced surfers who want to have more control and maneuverability.[32] when practicing the sport of surfing, the surfer paddles out past the wave break to wait for a wave. when a surfable wave arrives, the surfer must paddle extremely fast to match the velocity of the wave so the wave can accelerate him or her.[32] when the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, and stay toward the front of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. the acceleration is less toward the front than toward the back. the physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (f·sinθ) and the vertical force (f·cosθ=mg). therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain speed, and lean on the back foot to brake. also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.[32] surfing, like all water sports, carries the inherent risk of drowning.[39] anyone at any age can learn to surf, but should have at least intermediate swimming skills. although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user.[40] a leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. in some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer mark foo, a leash can even be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater.[41] by keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. a fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater.[41] surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. however, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.[42] under the wrong set of conditions, anything that a surfer's body can come in contact with is a potential hazard, including sand bars, rocks, small ice, reefs, surfboards, and other surfers.[43] collisions with these objects can sometimes cause injuries such as cuts and scrapes and in rare instances, death. a large number of injuries, up to 66%,[44] are caused by collision with a surfboard (nose or fins). fins can cause deep lacerations and cuts,[45] as well as bruising. while these injuries can be minor, they can open the skin to infection from the sea; groups like surfers against sewage campaign for cleaner waters to reduce the risk of infections. local bugs and disease can be risk factors when surfing around the globe.[46] falling off a surfboard or colliding with others is commonly referred to as a wipeout. sea life can sometimes cause injuries and even fatalities. animals such as sharks,[47] stingrays, weever fish, seals and jellyfish can sometimes present a danger.[48] warmer-water surfers often do the ""stingray shuffle"" as they walk out through the shallows, shuffling their feet in the sand to scare away stingrays that may be resting on the bottom.[49] rip currents are water channels that flow away from the shore. under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. since a rip current appears to be an area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of 12–15 m (40–50 ft). the flow of water moving out towards the sea in a rip will be stronger than most swimmers, making swimming back to shore difficult, however, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.[50] the seabed can pose a risk for surfers. if a surfer falls while riding a wave, the wave tosses and tumbles the surfer around, often in a downwards direction. at reef breaks and beach breaks, surfers have been seriously injured and even killed, because of a violent collision with the sea bed, the water above which can sometimes be very shallow, especially at beach breaks or reef breaks during low tide. cyclops, western australia, for example, is one of the biggest and thickest reef breaks in the world, with waves measuring up to 10 m (33 ft) high, but the reef below is only about 2 m (7 ft) below the surface of the water. a january 2018 study by the university of exeter called the ""beach bum survey"" found surfers and bodyboarders to be three times as likely as non-surfers to harbor antibiotic-resistant e. coli and four times as likely to harbor other bacteria capable of easily becoming antibiotic resistant. the researchers attributed this to the fact that surfers swallow roughly ten times as much seawater as swimmers.[51][52] surfers should use ear protection such as ear plugs to avoid surfer's ear, inflammation of the ear or other damage. surfer's ear is where the bone near the ear canal grows after repeated exposure to cold water, making the ear canal narrower. the narrowed canal makes it harder for water to drain from the ear. this can result in pain, infection and sometimes ringing of the ear. if surfer's ear develops it does so after repeated surfing sessions. yet, damage such as inflammation of the ear can occur after only surfing once. this can be caused by repeatedly falling off the surfboard into the water and having the cold water rush into the ears, which can exert a damaging amount of pressure. those with sensitive ears should therefore wear ear protection, even if they are not planning to surf very often.[53] ear plugs designed for surfers, swimmers and other water athletes are primarily made to keep water out of the ear, thereby letting a protective pocket of air stay inside the ear canal. they can also block cold air, dirt and bacteria. many designs are made to let sound through, and either float and/or have a leash in case the plug accidentally gets bumped out.[54][55] surfer's eye (pterygium (conjunctiva)) is a gradual tissue growth on the cornea of the eye which ultimately can lead to vision loss. the cause of the condition is unclear, but appears to be partly related to long term exposure to uv light, dust and wind exposure. prevention may include wearing sunglasses and a hat if in an area with strong sunlight. surfers and other water-sport athletes should therefore wear eye protection that blocks 100% of the uv rays from the water, as is often used by snow-sport athletes. surf goggles often have a head strap and ventilation to avoid fogging[56][57] users of contact lenses should take extra care, and may consider wearing surfing goggles. some risks of exposing contact lenses to the elements that can cause eye damage or infections are sand or organisms in the sea water getting between the eye and contact lens, or that lenses might fold.[58][59] surfer's myelopathy is a rare spinal cord injury causing paralysis of the lower extremities, caused by hyperextension of the back. this is due to one of the main blood vessels of the spine becoming kinked, depriving the spinal cord of oxygen. in some cases the paralysis is permanent. although any activity where the back is arched can cause this condition (i.e. yoga, pilates, etc.), this rare phenomenon has most often been seen in those surfing for the first time. according to dpt sergio florian, some recommendations for preventing myelopathy is proper warm up, limiting the session length and sitting on the board while waiting for waves, rather than lying.[60] beginner surfer in pacific beach, california surfer in pacific beach, california

tiger," the tiger (panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus panthera. it is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. it is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. it is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own. the tiger once ranged widely from the eastern anatolia region in the west to the amur river basin, and in the south from the foothills of the himalayas to bali in the sunda islands. since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in western and central asia, from the islands of java and bali, and in large areas of southeast and south asia and china. today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the indian subcontinent and sumatra. the tiger is listed as endangered on the iucn red list. as of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small pockets isolated from each other. india currently hosts the largest tiger population. major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, in particular in range countries with a high human population density. the tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. it featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. the tiger is the national animal of india, bangladesh, malaysia and south korea. the middle english tigre and old english tigras derive from old french tigre, from latin tigris. this was a borrowing of classical greek τίγρις 'tigris', a foreign borrowing of unknown origin meaning 'tiger' as well as the river tigris.[4] the origin may have been the persian word tigra meaning 'pointed or sharp', and the avestan word tigrhi 'arrow', perhaps referring to the speed of the tiger's leap, although these words are not known to have any meanings associated with tigers.[5] the generic name panthera is derived from the latin word panthera, and the ancient greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.[6] the sanskrit word पाण्डर pāṇḍ-ara means 'pale yellow, whitish, white'.[7] in 1758, carl linnaeus described the tiger in his work systema naturae and gave it the scientific name felis tigris.[2] in 1929, the british taxonomist reginald innes pocock subordinated the species under the genus panthera using the scientific name panthera tigris.[8][9] following linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, several tiger specimens were described and proposed as subspecies.[11] the validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999. most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence characteristics that vary widely within populations. morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the pleistocene. therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely p. t. tigris in mainland asia, and p. t. sondaica in the greater sunda islands.[12] results of craniological analysis of 111 tiger skulls from southeast asian range countries indicate that sumatran tiger skulls differ from indochinese and javan tiger skulls, whereas bali tiger skulls are similar in size to javan tiger skulls. the authors proposed to classify sumatran and javan tiger as distinct species, p. sumatrae and p. sondaica with bali tiger as subspecies p. sondaica balica.[13] in 2015, morphological, ecological, and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. results support distinction of the two evolutionary groups continental and sunda tigers. the authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely p. t. tigris comprising the bengal, malayan, indochinese, south chinese, siberian and caspian tiger populations, and p. t. sondaica comprising the javan, bali and sumatran tiger populations. the authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management. the nominate subspecies p. t. tigris constitutes two clades:[14] one conservation specialist welcomed this proposal as it would make captive breeding programmes and future rewilding of zoo-born tigers easier. one geneticist was sceptical of this study and maintained that the currently recognised nine subspecies can be distinguished genetically.[15] in 2017, the cat classification task force of the iucn cat specialist group revised felid taxonomy and recognized the tiger populations in continental asia as p. t. tigris, and those in the sunda islands as p. t. sondaica.[16] the following tables are based on the classification of the species panthera tigris provided in mammal species of the world.[11] it also reflects the classification used by the cat classification task force in 2017: a study published in 2018 was based on 32 tiger specimens using the whole-genome sequencing approach for analysis. results support six monophyletic tiger clades corresponding with the living subspecies and indicate that the most recent common ancestor lived about 110,000 years ago.[31] the tiger's closest living relatives were previously thought to be the panthera species lion, leopard and jaguar. results of genetic analysis indicate that about 2.88 million years ago, the tiger and the snow leopard lineages diverged from the other panthera species, and that both may be more closely related to each other than to the lion, leopard and jaguar.[32][33] the geographic origin of the panthera is most likely northern central asia or the holarctic region. the tiger–snow leopard lineage dispersed in southeast asia during the miocene.[34] panthera zdanskyi is considered to be a sister taxon of the modern tiger. it lived at the beginning of the pleistocene about two million years ago, its fossil remains were excavated in gansu province of northwestern china. it was smaller and more ""primitive"", but functionally and ecologically similar to the modern tiger. it is disputed as to whether it had the striping pattern. northwestern china is thought to be the origin of the tiger lineage. tigers grew in size, possibly in response to adaptive radiations of prey species like deer and bovids, which may have occurred in southeast asia during the early pleistocene.[35] panthera tigris trinilensis lived about 1.2 million years ago and is known from fossils excavated near trinil in java.[36] the wanhsien, ngandong, trinil, and japanese tigers became extinct in prehistoric times.[37] tigers reached india and northern asia in the late pleistocene, reaching eastern beringia, japan, and sakhalin. some fossil skulls are morphologically distinct from lion skulls, which could indicate tiger presence in alaska during the last glacial period, about 100,000 years ago.[38] in the philippine island of palawan, two articulated phalanx bones were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools in ille cave near the village of new ibajay. they were smaller than mainland tiger fossils, possibly due to insular dwarfism. otherwise, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones,[39] so it may be that the tiger parts were imported from elsewhere, or that the tiger colonised palawan from borneo before the holocene, considering the proximity of the two islands.[40][41] fossil remains of tigers were also excavated in sri lanka, china, japan and sarawak (malaysia) dating to the late pliocene, pleistocene and early holocene.[38][42] the bornean tiger was apparently present in borneo between the late pleistocene and the holocene, but whether it went extinct in prehistoric or recent times has not been resolved.[42][43] results of a phylogeographic study indicate that all living tigers had a common ancestor 72,000–108,000 years ago.[24] the potential tiger range during the late pleistocene and holocene was predicted applying ecological niche modelling based on more than 500 tiger locality records combined with bioclimatic data. the resulting model shows a contiguous tiger range at the last glacial maximum, indicating gene flow between tiger populations in mainland asia. the caspian tiger population was likely connected to the bengal tiger population through corridors below elevations of 4,000 m (13,000 ft) in the hindu kush. the tiger populations on the sunda islands and mainland asia were possibly separated during interglacial periods.[44] the tiger's full genome sequence was published in 2013. it was found to have similar repeat composition to other cat genomes and an appreciably conserved synteny.[45] captive tigers were bred with lions to create hybrids called liger and tigon. they share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species. breeding hybrids is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conservation.[46] the liger is a cross between a male lion and a tigress. ligers are typically between 10 and 12 ft (3.0 and 3.7 m) in length, and weigh between 800 and 1,000 lb (360 and 450 kg) or more.[47] because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the corresponding growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species.[48] the less common tigon is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger.[46] because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene, tigons are around the same size as their parents.[48] some females are fertile and have occasionally given birth to litigons when mated to a male asiatic lion.[49] the tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body. its pelage is dense and heavy, and colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes that are unique in each individual.[50][22] stripes are likely advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade.[51][52] the tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids.[53] the orangish colour may also aid in camouflage as the tiger's prey are dichromats, and thus may perceive the cat as green and blended in with the vegetation.[54] a tiger's coat pattern is still visible when it is shaved. this is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and hair follicles embedded in the skin, similar to human beards (colloquially five o'clock shadow), and is in common with other big cats.[55] they have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. the pupils are circular with yellow irises. the small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black.[22] these spots are thought to play an important role in intraspecific communication.[56] the tiger's skull is similar to a lion's skull, with the frontal region usually less depressed or flattened, and a slightly longer postorbital region. the lion skull shows broader nasal openings. due to the variation in skull sizes of the two species, the structure of the lower jaw is a reliable indicator for their identification.[18] the tiger has fairly stout teeth; its somewhat curved canines are the longest among living felids with a crown height of up to 90 mm (3.5 in).[22] there is a notable sexual dimorphism between male and female tigers, with the latter being consistently smaller. the size difference between them is proportionally greater in the large tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. males also have wider forepaw pads, enabling sex to be identified from tracks.[57] it has been hypothesised that body size of different tiger populations may be correlated with climate and be explained by thermoregulation and bergmann's rule, or by distribution and size of available prey species.[22][58] generally, males vary in total length from 250 to 390 cm (8.2 to 12.8 ft) and weigh between 90 and 300 kg (200 and 660 lb) with skull length ranging from 316 to 383 mm (12.4 to 15.1 in). females vary in total length from 200 to 275 cm (6.56 to 9.02 ft), weigh 65 to 167 kg (143 to 368 lb) with skull length ranging from 268 to 318 mm (0.879 to 1.043 ft). in either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 m (24 to 43 in) of the total length. the bengal and siberian tigers are amongst the tallest cats in shoulder height. they are also ranked among the biggest cats that have ever existed reaching weights of more than 300 kg (660 lb).[22] the tigers of the sunda islands are smaller and less heavy than tigers in mainland asia, rarely exceeding 142 kg (313 lb) in weight.[25] there are three colour variants – white, golden and stripeless snow white – that now rarely occur in the wild due to the reduction of wild tiger populations, but continue in captive populations. the white tiger has white fur and sepia brown stripes. the golden tiger has a pale golden pelage with a blond tone and reddish-brown stripes. the snow white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale reddish-brown ringed tail. both snow white and golden tigers are homozygous for corin gene mutations.[59] a black tiger is a colour variant due to pseudo-melanism. they have thick stripes close together so that the background colour is barely visible between stripes.[60] the white tiger lacks pheomelanin (which creates the orange colour), and has dark sepia-brown stripes and blue eyes. this altered pigmentation is caused by a mutant gene that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, which is determined by a white locus. it is not an albino, as the black pigments are scarcely affected.[61][59] the mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein slc45a2. both parents need to have the allele for whiteness to have white cubs.[62] between the early and mid 20th century, white tigers were recorded and shot in the indian states of odisha, bihar, assam and in the area of rewa, madhya pradesh. the local maharaja started breeding tigers in the early 1950s and kept a white male tiger together with its normal-coloured daughter; they had white cubs.[63] to preserve this recessive trait, only a few white individuals were used in captive breeding, which led to a high degree of inbreeding. inbreeding depression is the main reason for many health problems of captive white tigers, including strabismus, stillbirth, deformities and premature death.[64] other physical defects include cleft palate and scoliosis.[65] the tiger species survival plan has condemned the breeding of white tigers, alleging they are of mixed ancestry and of unknown lineage. the genes responsible for white colouration are represented by 0.001% of the population. the disproportionate growth in numbers of white tigers points to inbreeding among homozygous recessive individuals. this would lead to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability.[66] the tiger historically ranged from eastern turkey and transcaucasia to the coast of the sea of japan, and from south asia across southeast asia to the indonesian islands of sumatra, java and bali.[50] since the end of the last glacial period, it was probably restricted by periods of deep snow lasting longer than six months.[67][68] currently, it occurs in less than 6% of its historical range, as it has been extirpated from southwest and central asia, large parts of southeast and east asia. it now mainly occurs in the indian subcontinent, the indochinese peninsula, sumatra and the russian far east. in china and myanmar, breeding populations appear to rely on immigration from neighbouring countries while its status in the korean peninsula is unknown.[1][69] the tiger is essentially associated with forest habitats.[42][70] tiger populations thrive where populations of wild cervids, bovids and suids are stable.[71] records in central asia indicate that it occurred foremost in tugay riverine forests along the atrek, amu darya, syr darya, hari, chu and ili rivers and their tributaries. in the caucasus, it inhabited hilly and lowland forests.[18] historical records in iran are known only from the southern coast of the caspian sea and adjacent alborz mountains.[72] in the amur-ussuri region, it inhabits korean pine and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, where riparian forests provide food and water, and serve as dispersal corridors for both tiger and ungulates.[68][73] on the indian subcontinent, it inhabits mainly tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests and the swamp forests of the sundarbans.[74] in the eastern himalayas, tigers were documented in temperate forest up to an elevation of 4,200 m (13,800 ft) in bhutan and of 3,630 m (11,910 ft) in the mishmi hills.[75][76] in thailand, it lives in deciduous and evergreen forests.[77] in laos, 14 tigers were documented in semi-evergreen and evergreen forest interspersed with grassland in nam et-phou louey national protected area during surveys from 2013 to 2017.[78] in sumatra, tiger populations range from lowland peat swamp forests to rugged montane forests.[79] when not subject to human disturbance, the tiger is mainly diurnal.[80] it does not often climb trees but cases have been recorded.[51] it is a strong swimmer and often bathes in ponds, lakes and rivers, thus keeping cool in the heat of the day.[81] individuals can cross rivers up to 7 km (4.3 mi) wide and can swim up to 29 km (18 mi) in a day.[82] during the 1980s, a tiger was observed frequently hunting prey through deep lake water in ranthambhore national park.[80] the tiger is a long-ranging species, and individuals disperse over distances of up to 650 km (400 mi) to reach tiger populations in other areas.[83] radio-collared tigers in chitwan national park started dispersing from their natal areas earliest at the age of 19 months. four females dispersed between 0 and 43.2 km (0.0 and 26.8 mi), and 10 males between 9.5 and 65.7 km (5.9 and 40.8 mi). none of them crossed open cultivated areas that were more than 10 km (6.2 mi) wide, but moved through forested habitat.[84] adult tigers lead largely solitary lives. they establish and maintain territories but have much wider home ranges within which they roam. resident adults of either sex generally confine their movements to their home ranges, within which they satisfy their needs and those of their growing cubs. individuals sharing the same area are aware of each other's movements and activities.[85] the size of the home range mainly depends on prey abundance, geographic area and sex of the individual.[51][22] in india, home ranges appear to be 50 to 1,000 km2 (19 to 386 sq mi) while in manchuria, they range from 500 to 4,000 km2 (190 to 1,540 sq mi). in nepal, defended territories are recorded to be 19 to 151 km2 (7.3 to 58.3 sq mi) for males and 10 to 51 km2 (3.9 to 19.7 sq mi) for females.[82] young female tigers establish their first territories close to their mother's. the overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out at a younger age to mark out their own area. a young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.[86] to identify his territory, the male marks trees by spraying urine[87][88] and anal gland secretions, as well as marking trails with scat and marking trees or the ground with their claws. females also use these ""scrapes"", as well as urine and scat markings. scent markings of this type allow an individual to pick up information on another's identity, sex and reproductive status. females in oestrus will signal their availability by scent marking more frequently and increasing their vocalisations.[51] although for the most part avoiding each other, tigers are not always territorial and relationships between individuals can be complex. an adult of either sex will sometimes share its kill with others, even those who may not be related to them. george schaller observed a male share a kill with two females and four cubs. unlike male lions, male tigers allow females and cubs to feed on the kill before the male is finished with it; all involved generally seem to behave amicably, in contrast to the competitive behaviour shown by a lion pride.[89] stephen mills described a social feeding event in ranthambhore national park: a dominant tigress they called padmini killed a 250 kg (550 lb) male nilgai – a very large antelope. they found her at the kill just after dawn with her three 14-month-old cubs, and they watched uninterrupted for the next ten hours. during this period the family was joined by two adult females and one adult male, all offspring from padmini's previous litters, and by two unrelated tigers, one female the other unidentified. by three o'clock there were no fewer than nine tigers round the kill.[86] occasionally, male tigers participate in raising cubs, usually their own, but this is extremely rare and not always well understood. in may 2015, amur tigers were photographed by camera traps in the sikhote-alin bioshpere reserve. the photos show a male amur tiger pass by, followed by a female and three cubs within the span of about two minutes.[90] in ranthambore, a male bengal tiger raised and defended two orphaned female cubs after their mother had died of illness. the cubs remained under his care, he supplied them with food, protected them from his rival and sister, and apparently also trained them.[91] male tigers are generally more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture.[92] once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, as long as they do not live in too close quarters.[86] the most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and sometimes results in the death of one of the males.[86][92] facial expressions include the ""defense threat"", where an individual bares its teeth, flattens its ears and its pupils enlarge. both males and females show a flehmen response, a characteristic grimace, when sniffing urine markings, but flehmen is more often associated with males detecting the markings made by tigresses in oestrus. like other panthera, tigers roar, particularly in aggressive situations, during the mating season or when making a kill. there are two different roars: the ""true"" roar is made using the hyoid apparatus and forced through an open mouth as it progressively closes, and the shorter, harsher ""coughing"" roar is made with the mouth open and teeth exposed. the ""true"" roar can be heard at up to 3 km (1.9 mi) away and is sometimes emitted three or four times in succession. when tense, tigers will moan, a sound similar to a roar but more subdued and made when the mouth is partially or completely closed. moaning can be heard 400 m (1,300 ft) away.[22] chuffing—soft, low-frequency snorting similar to purring in smaller cats—is heard in more friendly situations.[93] other vocal communications include grunts, woofs, snarls, miaows, hisses and growls.[22] in the wild, tigers mostly feed on large and medium-sized mammals, particularly ungulates weighing 60–250 kg (130–550 lb). range-wide, sambar deer, manchurian wapiti, barasingha and wild boar are significantly preferred. tigers are capable of taking down larger prey like adult gaur[94] but will also opportunistically eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.[95][51] they also prey on other predators, including dogs, leopards, pythons, bears, and crocodiles.[96] tigers generally do not prey on fully grown adult asian elephants and indian rhinoceros but incidents have been reported.[97][98][99] more often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken.[100] when in close proximity to humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys. although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for dietary fibre such as fruit of the slow match tree.[96] tigers are thought to be mainly nocturnal predators,[70] but in areas where humans are absent, remote-controlled, hidden camera traps recorded them hunting in daylight.[101] they generally hunt alone and ambush their prey as most other cats do, overpowering them from any angle, using their body size and strength to knock the prey off balance. successful hunts usually require the tiger to almost simultaneously leap onto its quarry, knock it over, and grab the throat or nape with its teeth.[82] despite their large size, tigers can reach speeds of about 49–65 km/h (30–40 mph) but only in short bursts; consequently, tigers must be close to their prey before they break cover. if the prey senses the tiger's presence before this, the tiger usually abandons the hunt rather than chase prey or battle it head-on. horizontal leaps of up to 10 m (33 ft) have been reported, although leaps of around half this distance are more typical. one in 2 to 20 hunts, including stalking near potential prey, ends in a successful kill.[82][70] when hunting larger animals, tigers prefer to bite the throat and use their powerful forelimbs to hold onto the prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. the tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation.[89] by this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much.[102] although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select the calves or infirm of very large species.[103] healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. no other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on its own.[18][104] with smaller prey, such as monkeys and hares, the tiger bites the nape, often breaking the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe, or severing the jugular vein or common carotid artery.[105] though rarely observed, some tigers have been recorded to kill prey by swiping with their paws, which are powerful enough to smash the skulls of domestic cattle,[96] and break the backs of sloth bears.[106] after killing their prey, tigers sometimes drag it to conceal it in vegetative cover, usually pulling it by grasping with their mouths at the site of the killing bite. this, too, can require great physical strength. in one case, after it had killed an adult gaur, a tiger was observed to drag the massive carcass over a distance of 12 m (39 ft). when 13 men simultaneously tried to drag the same carcass later, they were unable to move it.[82] an adult tiger can go for up to two weeks without eating, then gorge on 34 kg (75 lb) of flesh at one time. in captivity, adult tigers are fed 3 to 6 kg (6.6 to 13.2 lb) of meat a day.[82] tigers usually prefer to eat prey they have caught themselves, but may eat carrion in times of scarcity and may even pirate prey from other large carnivores. although predators typically avoid one another, if a prey item is under dispute or a serious competitor is encountered, displays of aggression are common. if these are not sufficient, the conflicts may turn violent; tigers may kill competitors as leopards, dholes, striped hyenas, wolves, bears, pythons, and crocodiles on occasion. tigers may also prey on these competitors.[27][106][107][108][109] attacks on smaller predators, such as badgers, lynxes, and foxes, are almost certainly predatory.[95] crocodiles, bears, and large packs of dholes may win conflicts against tigers and, in the cases of crocodiles and bears, even can kill them.[27][18][110][111] the considerably smaller leopard avoids competition from tigers by hunting at different times of the day and hunting different prey.[112] in india's nagarhole national park, most prey selected by leopards were from 30 to 175 kg (66 to 386 lb) against a preference for prey weighing over 176 kg (388 lb) in the tigers. the average prey weight in the two respective big cats in india was 37.6 kg (83 lb) against 91.5 kg (202 lb).[113][114] with relatively abundant prey, tigers and leopards were seen to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or interspecies dominance hierarchies that may be more common to the african savanna, where the leopard exists with the lion.[113] golden jackals may feed on the tiger's kills.[115] tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of a forest while smaller predators like leopards and dholes are pushed closer to the fringes.[116] the tiger mates all year round, but most cubs are born between march and june, with a second peak in september. gestation ranges from 93 to 114 days, with an average of 103 to 105 days. a female is only receptive for three to six days.[117] mating is frequent and noisy during that time.[50] the female gives birth in a sheltered location such as in tall grass, in a dense thicket, cave or rocky crevice. the father generally takes no part in rearing.[18] litters consist of two or three cubs, rarely as many as six. cubs weigh from 780 to 1,600 g (1.72 to 3.53 lb) each at birth, and are born with eyes closed. they open their eyes when they are six to 14 days old.[117] their milk teeth break through at the age of about two weeks. they start to eat meat at the age of eight weeks. at around this time, females usually shift them to a new den.[50] they make short ventures with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. females lactate for five to six months.[117] around the time they are weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and are taught how to hunt.[80] a dominant cub emerges in most litters, usually a male. the dominant cub is more active than its siblings and takes the lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier.[80] the cubs start hunting on their own earliest at the age of 11 months, and become independent around 18 to 20 months of age.[89] they separate from their mother at the age of two to two and a half years, but continue to grow until the age of five years.[50] young females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males at four to five years.[18] unrelated wandering male tigers often kill cubs to make the female receptive, since the tigress may give birth to another litter within five months if the cubs of the previous litter are lost. the mortality rate of tiger cubs is about 50% in the first two years. few other predators attack tiger cubs due to the diligence and ferocity of the mother. apart from humans and other tigers, common causes of cub mortality are starvation, freezing, and accidents.[104] generation length of the tiger is about eight years.[118] the oldest recorded captive tiger lived for 26 years.[82] in the 1990s, a new approach to tiger conservation was developed: tiger conservation units (tcus), which are blocks of habitat that have the potential to host tiger populations in 15 habitat types within five bioregions. altogether 143 tcus were identified and prioritized based on size and integrity of habitat, poaching pressure and population status. they range in size from 33 to 155,829 km2 (13 to 60,166 sq mi).[74] in 2016, an estimate of a global wild tiger population of approximately 3,890 individuals was presented during the third asia ministerial conference on tiger conservation.[120][124] the wwf subsequently declared that the world's count of wild tigers had risen for the first time in a century.[125] major threats to the tiger include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching for fur and body parts, which have simultaneously greatly reduced tiger populations in the wild.[1] in india, only 11% of the historical tiger habitat remains due to habitat fragmentation.[126] demand for tiger parts for use in traditional chinese medicine has also been cited as a major threat to tiger populations.[127][128][129] some estimates suggest that there are fewer than 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals.[1] the global wild tiger population was estimated by the world wide fund for nature at 3,200 in 2011 and 3,890 in 2015—vox reported that this was the first increase in a century.[130][131] india is home to the world's largest population of wild tigers.[120] a 2014 census estimated a population of 2,226, a 30% increase since 2011.[132] on international tiger day 2019, the 'tiger estimation report 2018' was released by prime minister narendra modi. the report estimates a population of 2967 tigers in india with 25% increase since 2014. modi said ""india is one of the safest habitats for tigers as it has achieved the target of doubling the tiger population from 1411 in 2011 to 2967 in 2019"".[133] in 1973, india's project tiger, started by indira gandhi, established numerous tiger reserves. the project was credited with tripling the number of wild bengal tigers from some 1,200 in 1973 to over 3,500 in the 1990s, but a 2007 census showed that numbers had dropped back to about 1,400 tigers because of poaching.[134][135][136] following the report, the indian government pledged $153 million to the initiative, set up measures to combat poaching, promised funds to relocate up to 200,000 villagers in order to reduce human-tiger interactions,[137] and set up eight new tiger reserves.[138] india also reintroduced tigers to the sariska tiger reserve[139] and by 2009 it was claimed that poaching had been effectively countered at ranthambore national park.[140] in the 1940s, the siberian tiger was on the brink of extinction with only about 40 animals remaining in the wild in russia. as a result, anti-poaching controls were put in place by the soviet union and a network of protected zones (zapovedniks) were instituted, leading to a rise in the population to several hundred. poaching again became a problem in the 1990s, when the economy of russia collapsed. the major obstacle in preserving the species is the enormous territory individual tigers require (up to 450 km2 needed by a single female and more for a single male).[141] current conservation efforts are led by local governments and ngo's in concert with international organisations, such as the world wide fund for nature and the wildlife conservation society.[142] the competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by russian conservationists to convince hunters to tolerate the big cats. tigers have less impact on ungulate populations than do wolves, and are effective in controlling the latter's numbers.[143] in 2005, there were thought to be about 360 animals in russia, though these exhibited little genetic diversity.[144] however, in a decade later, the siberian tiger census was estimated from 480 to 540 individuals.[citation needed] in china, tigers became the target of large-scale 'anti-pest' campaigns in the early 1950s, where suitable habitats were fragmented following deforestation and resettlement of people to rural areas, who hunted tigers and prey species. though tiger hunting was prohibited in 1977, the population continued to decline and is considered extinct in southern china since 2001.[145][146] having earlier rejected the western-led environmentalist movement, china changed its stance in the 1980s and became a party to the cites treaty. by 1993 it had banned the trade in tiger parts, and this diminished the use of tiger bones in traditional chinese medicine.[147] the tibetan people's trade in tiger skins has also been a threat to tigers. the pelts were used in clothing, tiger-skin chuba being worn as fashion. in 2006 the 14th dalai lama was persuaded to take up the issue. since then there has been a change of attitude, with some tibetans publicly burning their chubas.[148] in 1994, the indonesian sumatran tiger conservation strategy addressed the potential crisis that tigers faced in sumatra. the sumatran tiger project (stp) was initiated in june 1995 in and around the way kambas national park in order to ensure the long-term viability of wild sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations.[149] by august 1999, the teams of the stp had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in lampung province, of which only 15 these were intact enough to contain tigers.[150] in the framework of the stp a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger-human dimension in the park in order to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions.[151] the wildlife conservation society and panthera corporation formed the collaboration tigers forever, with field sites including the world's largest tiger reserve, the 21,756 km2 (8,400 sq mi) hukaung valley in myanmar. other reserves were in the western ghats in india, thailand, laos, cambodia, the russian far east covering in total about 260,000 km2 (100,000 sq mi).[152] tigers have been studied in the wild using a variety of techniques. tiger population have been estimated using plaster casts of their pugmarks, although this method was criticized as being inaccurate.[153] more recent techniques include the use of camera traps and studies of dna from tiger scat, while radio-collaring has been used to track tigers in the wild.[154] tiger spray has been found to be just as good, or better, as a source of dna than scat.[155] the tiger has been one of the big five game animals of asia. tiger hunting took place on a large scale in the early 19th and 20th centuries, being a recognised and admired sport by the british in colonial india as well as the maharajas and aristocratic class of the erstwhile princely states of pre-independence india. a single maharaja or english hunter could claim to kill over a hundred tigers in their hunting career.[82] tiger hunting was done by some hunters on foot; others sat up on machans with a goat or buffalo tied out as bait; yet others on elephant-back.[156] historically, tigers have been hunted at a large scale so their famous striped skins could be collected. the trade in tiger skins peaked in the 1960s, just before international conservation efforts took effect. by 1977, a tiger skin in an english market was considered to be worth us$4,250.[82] tiger parts are commonly used as amulets in south and southeast asia. in the philippines, the fossils in palawan were found besides stone tools. this, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, suggests that early humans had accumulated the bones,[39] and the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the upper paleolithic. the tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the cortical bone due to weathering, which suggests that they had post-mortem been exposed to light and air. tiger canines were found in ambangan sites dating to the 10th to 12th centuries in butuan, mindanao.[40][41] many people in china and other parts of asia have a belief that various tiger parts have medicinal properties, including as pain killers and aphrodisiacs.[157] there is no scientific evidence to support these beliefs. the use of tiger parts in pharmaceutical drugs in china is already banned, and the government has made some offences in connection with tiger poaching punishable by death.[which?] furthermore, all trade in tiger parts is illegal under the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora and a domestic trade ban has been in place in china since 1993.[158] however, the trading of tiger parts in asia has become a major black market industry and governmental and conservation attempts to stop it have been ineffective to date.[82] almost all black marketers engaged in the trade are based in china and have either been shipped and sold within in their own country or into taiwan, south korea or japan.[82] the chinese subspecies was almost completely decimated by killing for commerce due to both the parts and skin trades in the 1950s through the 1970s.[82] contributing to the illegal trade, there are a number of tiger farms in the country specialising in breeding the cats for profit. it is estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 captive-bred, semi-tame animals live in these farms today.[159][160][161] however, many tigers for traditional medicine black market are wild ones shot or snared by poachers and may be caught anywhere in the tiger's remaining range (from siberia to india to the malay peninsula to sumatra). in the asian black market, a tiger penis can be worth the equivalent of around $300 u.s. dollars. in the years of 1990 through 1992, 27 million products with tiger derivatives were found.[82] in july 2014 at an international convention on endangered species in geneva, switzerland, a chinese representative admitted for the first time his government was aware trading in tiger skins was occurring in china.[162] wild tigers that have had no prior contact with humans actively avoid interactions with humans. however, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal.[82] attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between a mother and her young,[164] or as in a case in rural india when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle.[165] occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey.[51] for example, the champawat tiger, a tigress found in nepal and then india, had two broken canines. she was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, by the time she was shot in 1907 by jim corbett.[166] according to corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch.[167] early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.[168] man-eaters have been a particular problem in recent decades in india and bangladesh, especially in kumaon, garhwal and the sundarbans mangrove swamps of bengal, where some healthy tigers have hunted humans. because of rapid habitat loss attributed to climate change, tiger attacks have increased in the sundarbans.[169] the sundarbans area had 129 human deaths from tigers from 1969 to 1971. in the 10 years prior to that period, about 100 attacks per year in the sundarbans, with a high of around 430 in some years of the 1960s.[82] unusually, in some years in the sundarbans, more humans are killed by tigers than vice versa.[82] in 1972, india's production of honey and beeswax dropped by 50% when at least 29 people who gathered these materials were devoured.[82] in 1986 in the sundarbans, since tigers almost always attack from the rear, masks with human faces were worn on the back of the head, on the theory that tigers usually do not attack if seen by their prey. this decreased the number of attacks only temporarily. all other means to prevent attacks, such as providing more prey or using electrified human dummies, did not work as well.[170] in ancient roman times, tigers were kept in menageries and amphitheatres to be exhibited, trained and paraded, and were often provoked to fight humans and exotic beasts.[171][172] since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and ferocious, were sought after to keep at european castles as symbols of their owners' power.[173] tigers became central zoo and circus exhibits in the 18th century: a tiger could cost up to 4,000 francs in france (for comparison, a professor of the beaux-arts at lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year),[173] or up to $3,500 in the united states, where a lion cost no more than $1,000.[174] in 2007, over 4,000 captive tigers lived in china, of which 3,000 were held by about 20 larger facilities, with the rest held by some 200 smaller facilities.[175] in 2011, 468 facilities in the usa kept 2,884 tigers.[176] nineteen us states banned private ownership of tigers, fifteen require a license, and sixteen states have no regulation.[177] genetic ancestry of 105 captive tigers from fourteen countries and regions showed that forty-nine animals belonged distinctly to five subspecies; fifty-two animals had mixed subspecies origins.[178] many siberian tigers in zoos today are actually the result of crosses with bengal tigers.""[179] tigers and their superlative qualities have been a source of fascination for mankind since ancient times, and they are routinely visible as important cultural and media motifs. they are also considered one of the charismatic megafauna, and are used as the face of conservation campaigns worldwide. in a 2004 online poll conducted by cable television channel animal planet, involving more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog.[180] in chinese myth and culture, the tiger is one of the 12 animals of the chinese zodiac. in chinese art, the tiger is depicted as an earth symbol and equal rival of the chinese dragon – the two representing matter and spirit respectively. the southern chinese martial art hung ga is based on the movements of the tiger and the crane. in imperial china, a tiger was the personification of war and often represented the highest army general (or present day defense secretary),[181] while the emperor and empress were represented by a dragon and phoenix, respectively. the white tiger (chinese: 白虎; pinyin: bái hǔ) is one of the four symbols of the chinese constellations. it is sometimes called the white tiger of the west (chinese: 西方白虎), and it represents the west and the autumn season.[181] the tiger's tail appears in stories from countries including china and korea, it being generally inadvisable to grasp a tiger by the tail.[182][183] in korean myth and culture, the tiger is regarded as a guardian that drives away evil spirits and a sacred creature that brings good luck – the symbol of courage and absolute power. for the people who live in and around the forests of korea, the tiger considered the symbol of the mountain spirit or king of mountain animals. so, koreans also called the tigers ""san gun"" (산군) means mountain lord.[184] in buddhism, the tiger is one of the three senseless creatures, symbolising anger, with the monkey representing greed and the deer lovesickness.[181] the tungusic peoples considered the siberian tiger a near-deity and often referred to it as ""grandfather"" or ""old man"". the udege and nanai called it ""amba"". the manchu considered the siberian tiger as ""hu lin,"" the king.[57] in hinduism, the god shiva wears and sits on tiger skin.[185] the ten-armed warrior goddess durga rides the tigress (or lioness) damon into battle. in southern india the god ayyappan was associated with a tiger.[186] in greco-roman tradition, the tiger was depicted being ridden by the god dionysus.[187] the weretiger replaces the werewolf in shapeshifting folklore in asia;[188] in india they were evil sorcerers, while in indonesia and malaysia they were somewhat more benign.[189] in the hindu epic mahabharata, the tiger is fiercer and more ruthless than the lion.[190] in william blake's poem in his songs of experience (1794), titled ""the tyger"", the tiger is a menacing and fearful animal.[191] in yann martel's 2001 man booker prize winning novel life of pi, the protagonist, surviving shipwreck for months in a small boat, somehow avoids being eaten by the other survivor, a large bengal tiger. the story was adapted in ang lee's 2012 feature film of the same name.[192] jim corbett's 1944 man-eaters of kumaon tells ten true stories of his tiger-hunting exploits in what is now the northern uttarakhand region of india. the book has sold over four million copies,[193] and has been the basis of both fictional and documentary films. in rudyard kipling's 1894 the jungle book, the tiger, shere khan, is the mortal enemy of the human protagonist, mowgli.[191] more benign tiger characters include tigger in a. a. milne's winnie-the-pooh and hobbes of the comic strip calvin and hobbes, both of whom are represented as simply stuffed animals come to life.[194] tigers are also mascots for various sports teams around the world. tony the tiger is a famous mascot for kellogg's breakfast cereal frosted flakes, known for its catchphrase ""they're gr-r-reat!"".[195] the esso (exxon) brand of petrol was advertised from 1959 onwards with the slogan 'put a tiger in your tank', and a tiger mascot; more than 2.5 million synthetic tiger tails were sold to motorists, who tied them to their petrol tank caps.[196] the tiger is one of the animals displayed on the pashupati seal of the indus valley civilisation. the tiger was the emblem of the chola dynasty and was depicted on coins, seals and banners.[197] the seals of several chola copper coins show the tiger, the pandyan emblem fish and the chera emblem bow, indicating that the cholas had achieved political supremacy over the latter two dynasties. gold coins found in kavilayadavalli in the nellore district of andhra pradesh have motifs of the tiger, bow and some indistinct marks.[198] the tiger symbol of chola empire was later adopted by the liberation tigers of tamil eelam and the tiger became a symbol of the unrecognised state of tamil eelam and tamil independence movement.[199] the bengal tiger is the national animal of india and bangladesh.[200] the malaysian tiger is the national animal of malaysia.[201] the siberian tiger is the national animal of south korea. the tyger, a depiction of tigers as they were understood by european artists, is among the creatures used in charges and supporters in european heraldry. this creature has several notable differences from real tigers, including absent stripes, a leonine tufted tail, and a head terminating in large, pointed jaws. a more realistic version of the tiger entered the heraldic armory through the british empire's expansion into asia, and is referred to as the bengal tiger to distinguish it from its older counterpart. the bengal tiger is not a very common creature in heraldry, but is present as a supporter in the arms of bombay and emblazoned on the shield of the university of madras.[202] "
